channelnewsasia,Vietnam steps up talks with US to reduce hefty tariff,"HANOI: Vietnam and the United States held their first direct ministerial-level negotiations on Friday (May 16) against the backdrop of an impending US tariff of 46 per cent on imports from the Southeast Asian nation, which could significantly impact its growth.

The Vietnamese trade ministry said in a statement released on Saturday that the meeting, which occurred in Jeju, South Korea, following the 31st APEC Ministerial Meeting on Trade, symbolised both nations' commitment to fostering a stable economic, trade, and investment relationship.

The talks follow a phone call last month between Vietnamese trade minister Nguyen Hong Dien and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer that officially started negotiations.

""USTR Greer agreed with Vietnam's current approach and proposal,"" the trade ministry's statement said. ""The United States hopes that with the mutual efforts, the technical-level negotiations in the coming days will yield positive results.""



The US has postponed the implementation of the 46 per cent tariff on Vietnam until July. If enforced, the levy could disrupt growth in Vietnam, which is heavily dependent on sales to the United States, its largest export market, and substantial foreign investments in manufacturing goods for export.

Vietnam has the fourth-largest trade surplus among all US trading partners, worth $123.5 billion last year.

In an attempt to diminish that trade surplus, Hanoi has recently implemented several measures, including reducing tariffs on a multitude of goods destined for the US and intensifying its efforts to curb the shipment of Chinese goods to the US via its territory.

channelnewsasia,‘Risk being sidelined’: US-China trade truce raises stakes for ASEAN members seeking lower Trump tariffs,"KUALA LUMPUR: A temporary deal struck between the United States and China on Monday (May 12) that put the brakes on an escalating trade war has raised the stakes for Southeast Asian countries trying to negotiate tariff reductions with Washington, analysts say.

With the 90-day deal between the two global powers, Southeast Asian countries will race to wrap up trade talks with the US, as the clock ticks towards a Jul 8 deadline when Washington might reinstate steeper “reciprocal” tariff rates slapped on most countries in the world.

Southeast Asian countries, hit with some of the harshest tariff rates, will be wary of emerging from US talks with higher rates than China as this will hurt their competitiveness and investment appeal, observers said.

After talks in Geneva last weekend, the US agreed to lower tariffs on Chinese goods to 30 per cent, down from the previous 145 per cent.



This 30 per cent rate comprises the 10 per cent baseline rate and 20 per cent punitive levies aimed at curbing China’s export of chemicals used to make fentanyl, an opioid that has caused tens of thousands of deaths in the US.

In return, China agreed to lower its retaliatory 125 per cent tariffs on US goods to the baseline 10 per cent.

Talks on a more comprehensive trade agreement are set to continue before the truce expires on Aug 12.

If Beijing ends up with a lower US tariff rate than Southeast Asian countries after Aug 12, the latter’s relative attractiveness as an investment and manufacturing alternative to China could be “diminished”, said Joanne Lin, senior fellow and co-coordinator of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Studies Centre at Singapore’s ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute.

“This is especially concerning for countries like Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia, which have benefited from Chinese firms relocating production during the height of the US-China trade tensions,” she said.

“A lower tariff regime for China would reduce the incentive for these relocations and could slow foreign direct investment inflows to ASEAN tied to supply chain diversification.”

Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia are understood to be part of US President Donald Trump’s so-called “Dirty 15” list of nations that account for the bulk of US trading volume but have supposedly imposed hefty tariffs and other non-tariff barriers on US goods.

The trio is also believed to be part of a list of roughly 20 countries that Bloomberg reported on May 10 are the focus of early negotiations with the US, with those in Southeast Asia considered a priority.

US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told CNBC on May 9 that Washington is “having fruitful talks with Vietnam and others, and they understand what we’re trying to solve for”.

“The outcomes of bilateral negotiations between US and ASEAN countries will thus be important to determine if Southeast Asian countries can maintain their competitive edge or risk being sidelined in a reconfigured global trade landscape,” Lin said.

This fear could well become reality in Indonesia, whose economy is vulnerable to the potential effects of a trade war and is currently negotiating a potential 32 per cent US tariff rate.

Jakarta has proposed to increase its annual imports from the US by up to US$19 billion by switching to US suppliers for goods such as wheat, soybean, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and crude.

The country has issued new rules to allow the government to procure goods with lower locally-produced content, addressing a jarring non-tariff barrier identified by the US, Reuters reported on May 6.

While the temporary deal between the US and China spells good news for Indonesia’s raw material exports to China, whose factories are rushing to ship goods to the US, Southeast Asia as a whole might suffer if Beijing eventually gets a much lower tariff rate than ASEAN countries, said Bhima Yudhistira Adhinegara, director of the Center of Economic and Law Studies in Indonesia.

“There will be many investments from China going back again to China. There will be a relocation of the Southeast Asian factories back to China again,” he told CNA.

“Investment from Europe and the US will be flowing to China. So, I think this also makes for negative signs for each individual member country in ASEAN pushing for more negotiations with the US.”

Bhima feels Indonesia – Southeast Asia’s largest economy – has been “left behind” in negotiations with the US compared to China, noting how the latter has managed to secure a temporary but substantial discount on its own tariff rates.

“I think China made really good progress compared with Indonesia, of which we don't see the outcome of the negotiation process yet,” he said, citing challenges that come with the concessions Jakarta has proposed.

“If Indonesia buys more LPG or imports more oil from the US, there will be a huge burden (on) the state budget, to the fiscal space.”

While talks between Indonesia and the US are ongoing, Thailand’s negotiation on its 36 per cent US tariff rate seems to have stalled.

A meeting between Thai and US officials scheduled for Apr 23 was cancelled after Thai officials based in the US reportedly wanted to review specific issues that would be raised in the negotiations.

Thailand has offered to step up imports of US commodities such as corn, natural gas and ethane, besides reducing import duties and removing non-tariff barriers to secure a deal.

The latter includes stricter inspection of goods shipped to the US, to prevent counterfeiting by third countries trying to dodge the high tariffs they face.

Thai premier Paetongtarn Shinawatra said on May 4 that her government remains in informal contact with US trade officials, and that she was confident talks would start before the 90-day pause lapses.

Paetongtarn said a “secret deal” with the US remains a possibility, the Bangkok Post reported, and that her government was “discussing the details of what it might achieve, and how flexible it could be”.

Reuters reported on Tuesday that Thailand has sent a trade proposal to the US, quoting Paetongtarn as saying officials were “waiting for the right time” to make an appointment for talks with Washington.

But a Thai analyst told CNA that “public discontent” appears to be brewing in Thailand after it apparently emerged that the country was not among the 20 nations to get early talks with the US, bringing Paetongtarn “dangerously close to the knife’s edge”.

“If no deal is reached before Jul 8, tariffs on products from ASEAN could surpass those imposed on Chinese goods,” said Wannaphong Durongkaveroj, an economics professor at Ramkhamhaeng University.

“The US-China deal underscores the need for ASEAN – particularly Thailand, which has yet to initiate official talks with the US – to develop a clear and comprehensive strategy.”

That said, Wannaphong believes there is “limited value” in drawing lessons for Southeast Asia from the US-China agreement, noting that Beijing is the primary focus of Trump’s trade policy.

“What the deal does highlight, however, is the high level of uncertainty and the political cost for the Thai government of remaining in a passive, wait-and-see posture,” he said.

“There is clearly a race among ASEAN leaders to secure bilateral deals with Trump,” Wannaphong added.

Thailand’s neighbour Malaysia sent a delegation to Washington from Apr 22 to Apr 24, and Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim told parliament on May 5 that Putrajaya could possibly negotiate a reduction on its threatened 24 per cent tariff rate.

Malaysia has said it is open to negotiating with the US on non-tariff barriers, reducing its bilateral trade surplus, and exploring a bilateral trade agreement.

These include strengthening technological safeguards and security, although few concrete details have been released.

Asrul Hadi Abdullah Sani, a partner at strategic advisory firm ADA Southeast Asia, told CNA that the US is unlikely to consider any tariff negotiations if Malaysia “does not bring numbers to the table” in reducing its trade surplus with Washington.

Malaysia must commit to increasing imports of US agricultural goods, machinery, technology and pharmaceutical products, as well as streamline and simplify processes for US goods to make the Malaysian market more accessible, he said.

“Crucially, foreign companies have advocated for the Malaysian government to relax its regulations and non-tariff barriers, even before Trump's Liberation Day,” Asrul Hadi said, referring to the initial announcement of reciprocal tariffs on Apr 2.

“This includes easing import controls, bumiputera requirements, and product regulations.”

Bhima from the Center of Economic and Law Studies said Vietnam, which is facing a 46 per cent tariff rate, appears to be the Southeast Asian frontrunner in striking a deal with the US.

Vietnam started official talks with the US on May 7, and Reuters reported on Tuesday that the country is stepping up its fight against counterfeits and digital piracy after the US accused it of being a major hub for such illicit activities.

Hanoi has dangled zero tariffs on US imports and pledged to buy much more US goods, such as Boeing planes and liquified natural gas. The government has also urged local manufacturers to buy American.

A major regional manufacturing base for many Western companies, Vietnam racked up a trade surplus of more than US$123 billion with the US last year.

Earlier in April, Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh said his country would buy more American weapons as part of efforts aimed at addressing the trade imbalance with the US.

Hanoi’s reported agreement to buy “no less than 24” Lockheed Martin F-16 fighter jets has created headlines. In an Apr 22 article, The Diplomat, a current affairs analysis site, said such a major US arms purchase would “at the very least send some tremors” in its relationship with China.

The American defence industry needs to expand to new markets in Southeast Asia, Bhima said, making the US more amenable to offers such as arms purchases in tariff negotiations.

“So if any individual country in Southeast Asia talks about defence cooperation, I think they will be the winner,” he said.

Many Southeast Asian countries are already offering to buy more American oil and gas, and Bhima said it would be a missed opportunity for Indonesia not to bring up greater cooperation with the US on the South China Sea.
 
ASEAN members Malaysia, Vietnam, Brunei and the Philippines have overlapping claims with China in the strategic and resource-rich waterway, most of which Beijing claims as its own.

Indonesia is not a direct South China Sea claimant but China’s “nine-dash line” overlaps with Indonesia’s exclusive economic zone near the oil- and gas-rich Natuna Islands.

“The Indonesian government still thinks that this is like a trade negotiation only; it's not involving any political kind of negotiation. So, that’s a little bit naive,” Bhima added.

“We also missed talking about buying more US weapons. But I don't know, maybe the Indonesian government is afraid of Russia, China and France also, because we are already buying Rafale fighter jets from France.”

ISEAS’ Lin said ASEAN countries are adopting different negotiation strategies with the US based on their strategic priorities, economic feasibility and domestic political considerations.

“However, balancing trade via increased imports may be more straightforward than addressing US concerns over non-tariff barriers,” she said, referring to accusations that some ASEAN countries might be serving as transshipment hubs for Chinese goods to evade US tariffs.

Negotiating non-tariff barriers is tricky as some policies, such as those related to public health, safety or national security, are grounded in legitimate regulatory frameworks, Lin explained.

“In contrast, more negotiable non-tariff barriers such as product standards or customs procedures can be modified or clarified more easily,” she said.

Ultimately, Lin said differences in outcomes were “inevitable” as some Southeast Asian countries might be able to negotiate steeper US tariff reductions depending on what they can offer in return, be it increased imports of US goods, defence cooperation or regulatory concessions.

“If these countries are seen as more ‘aligned’ with US interests or offer greater market access, they could become relatively more attractive destinations for foreign direct investments from companies in China or other third countries seeking tariff-resilient hubs,” she added.

“This could give certain ASEAN economies a temporary edge in regional supply chain positioning.”

The two deals the US reached with the United Kingdom and China, however, suggest that the baseline tariff rate of 10 per cent is here to stay, said Deborah Elms, who heads trade policy at the Asia-based Hinrich Foundation.

This means the US is unlikely to reduce its tariff rates to zero, she told CNA, making it less worthwhile for countries like Malaysia and the Philippines – which face the third- and second-lowest tariff rates in ASEAN at 24 per cent and 17 per cent respectively – to make “serious concessions” to the US.

“I’m not sure how ASEAN members might take requests to manage Chinese content in their supply chains. It was always a tough ask,” she said.

“But with US-China talks now stretching at least 90 days, it might be harder for ASEAN members to agree as they won’t know what broader package (agreed between the US and China) might be ahead.”

Lin said the US is likely looking for “tangible, sector-specific concessions” from Southeast Asian countries, while Elms pointed to an increasing need for them to discuss current and future sectoral tariffs with the US.

The US has applied a 25 per cent sectoral tariff on steel, aluminium and products made with these metals, as well as autos and auto parts.

“The first two are 25 per cent. The rest may be the same, higher or lower,” Elms said, noting in a separate commentary that semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, lumber, copper, heavy trucks, and critical minerals could be next in line.

“For Malaysia, semiconductors are in the pipeline with a definition of the sector that is extremely broad. If these products end up tariffed at high rates, that is likely to be more damaging than reciprocal tariffs.”

As this year’s ASEAN chairman, Anwar had said on Apr 6 that Malaysia will lead efforts to present a “united regional front” in the face of US tariffs.

A joint statement by ASEAN economic ministers after a special Apr 10 meeting on the tariffs expressed a “common intention to engage in a frank and constructive dialogue with the US”, while not imposing retaliatory tariffs.

They said ASEAN will also deepen regional economic integration, and continue to discuss ways to further strengthen and boost intra-ASEAN trade.

But observers previously told CNA that it would be most realistic for ASEAN to adopt a “hybrid approach” in addressing US tariffs.

This involves speaking with one voice to highlight the bloc's shared concerns while allowing member states to negotiate individually based on their own interests.

“Unlike the European Union, ASEAN is not a supranational union and does not have a single market through which it can engage the US collectively,” Asrul Hadi said.

“This is even more so given that each member state has varying tariff levels. Each country will have its own economic interests, outweighing the overall interests of ASEAN.”

The ASEAN statement on Apr 10 serves more as a symbolic show of unity than a negotiating tool, especially given the Trump administration’s clear preference for bilateral transactional deals, Lin added.

“National-level strategies may undercut ASEAN’s cohesion or inadvertently disrupt intra-regional trade flows but in a fragmented global trade environment, some degree of competition is inevitable.”

There are already signs that offers made in individual negotiations between ASEAN member states and the US could disrupt intra-ASEAN trade.

Thai PM Paetongtarn stated that any “secret collaboration” with the US on trade cannot be disclosed, as other countries in similar negotiations “will know and comparisons will be made and turmoil will follow”.

Indonesia’s Energy Minister Bahlil Lahadalia said his country plans to change the source of some of its fuel imports from Singapore to the US as part of negotiations, Reuters reported on May 9.

Indonesia could shift as much as 60 per cent of its total fuel imports from Singapore to the US in the early stages of what would be a gradual process, he said.

Previously, there were “high hopes” Indonesia could work with other ASEAN trading partners in discussing tariffs with the US, Bhima said.

“But perhaps it's very, very pragmatic to see that Donald Trump does not like multilateralism and instead prefers going to individual countries,” he said.

“That's why Indonesia is also going to be more pragmatic - national interest first, even though they will disappoint Singapore or other ASEAN members.”

Wannaphong said he does not believe individual negotiations with the US would necessarily undermine ASEAN unity.

But he added “it remains unclear to me what ASEAN, as a bloc, can realistically do - especially when the region is among the hardest hit by Trump’s tariffs”.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/us-tariffs-china-asean-southeast-asia-negotiations-stakes-5131761,2025-05-17T12:58:06Z
channelnewsasia,Thai construction magnate surrenders on felony negligence charges over building collapse in quake,"BANGKOK: A construction magnate and more than a dozen other people surrendered to police Friday (May 16) on criminal negligence charges for the collapse of a Bangkok high-rise during a Mar 28 earthquake.

Premchai Karnasuta, the president of Italian-Thai Development Co, the main Thai contractor for the building project, as well as designers and engineers, were among 17 charged with the felony of professional negligence causing death, Bangkok deputy police chief Noppasin Poonsawat said.

The accused have publicly denied wrongdoing.

Ninety-two people were confirmed dead in the rubble of the building that had been under construction and a small number of other people remain unaccounted for.



The building, which was to become a new State Audit Office, was the only one in Thailand to collapse in the earthquake that was centred in neighbouring Myanmar.

Noppasin said at a news conference that evidence and testimony from experts suggested the building plan did not meet standards and codes.

The Bangkok Post newspaper said police had also determined the project showed ""structural flaws in the core lift shaft and substandard concrete and steel”.

Thai media have reported allegations of wrongdoing in the project almost every day since the building’s collapse, many of them involving irregular documentation for the project.

Their reports have highlighted the role of Italian-Thai’s Chinese joint venture partner, the China Railway No 10 company, which is involved in projects around the world.

A Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for the 17 on Thursday. Noppasin said 15 turned themselves in at a police station in the morning and the remaining two were expected to do so later Friday.

channelnewsasia,"Malaysia to resume recruitment of stranded Bangladeshi workers, vows to protect them from abuse, fraud","PETALING JAYA, Selangor: Bangladeshi workers barred from entering Malaysia for employment before a deadline kicked in almost a year ago will soon be able to do so, according to its Home Affairs Minister.

On Thursday (May 15), Saifuddin Nasution Ismail also reaffirmed Putrajaya’s commitment to protect them from “exploitation and employment fraud”.

Malaysia had barred the entry of Bangladeshi workers since May 31 last year after tens of thousands of them reportedly became victims of an extensive labour scam in the country that saw them paying up to US$5,000 upfront for jobs that did not exist, forcing them to work illegally to pay debts.

The latest developments were announced following meetings on Thursday (May 15) between Adviser to Bangladesh’s Ministry of Expatriates’ Welfare and Overseas Employment Asif Nazrul and Saifuddin as well as Human Resources Minister Steven Sim in Kuala Lumpur.



“This meeting provided an opportunity for in-depth discussions on issues concerning the management of foreign workers from Bangladesh, which involve several policy and operational matters, including the government’s key commitment to reduce migration cost,” Saifuddin wrote on Facebook on Thursday.

Following the meetings, the Bangladesh High Commission in Kuala Lumpur confirmed that Malaysia has agreed to recruit 7,964 workers from among more than 17,000 who were stranded after failing to enter the country before the May 31 deadline last year, “despite fulfilling all conditions and paying (the) full migration cost”.

The commission said in a Facebook post on Thursday that these workers would be “in the first batch as proposed by Bangladesh and the recruitment process of those workers will be handled by (the) Bangladesh Overseas Employment Services Limited”.

Some of these workers reportedly with approved work visas were unable to get on flights before the deadline last year and the Bangladeshi government has urged the Malaysian government to allow them to enter the country since last year.

A meeting was previously held between the Bangladesh High Commission to Malaysia and Saifuddin in Kuala Lumpur on Dec 5 last year to address the prolonged delay in the migration process of the workers, local media reported.

A joint technical group, comprising representatives from the Malaysian Immigration Department and the commission, was subsequently established and held two meetings, on Dec 31 last year and Jan 14 this year.

During the joint technical group meetings, the list of over 17,000 workers was thoroughly reviewed and verified with Malaysian stakeholders, resulting in the selection of the 7,964 workers for immediate entry in the first phase, Mohammad Rafiqul Alam - a spokesperson from the Bangladesh Ministry of Foreign Affairs - told Malay Mail earlier in January.

While these workers have been deemed eligible for immediate travel to Malaysia, it is unclear when they will officially start working.

During the meeting on Thursday between Sim, the Human Resources Minister and Asif, both nations also agreed to strengthen their coordination through the joint working group which will reconvene in Dhaka next week from May 21 to address technical matters related to labour management, Free Malaysia Today (FMT) reported.

“This visit (on Thursday) signals a shared resolve by Malaysia and Bangladesh to build a cross-border labour system grounded in integrity, human rights and fairness,” the human resources ministry said on Thursday, as quoted by FMT.

The Bangladeshi delegation had also requested multiple-entry visas for their workers.

“The Malaysian government informed (us) that they are currently working on a proposal to revisit the provision of single-entry visas for Bangladeshi workers. Hopefully, very soon the Bangladeshi workers will be granted multiple entry visas,” the Bangladesh High Commission wrote on Thursday.

At Thursday’s meeting, Saifuddin also conveyed Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim’s appreciation to the Bangladeshi government for its continued support in efforts to streamline the management of foreign workers in Malaysia.

Malaysia is host to more than 400,000 documented Bangladesh workers and several thousands more who enter the country illegally, and they make up one of the largest country proportions of foreign workers in the world, which collectively account for roughly 30 per cent of the national workforce that is estimated at 17 million people.

Meanwhile, the Bangladeshi government has also confirmed that Malaysia was not involved in any misconduct concerning the recruitment or treatment of its workers, following reports that Putrajaya had asked Bangladesh to review and withdraw “unsubstantiated allegations” of wrongdoing in labour migration between the two countries.

Bloomberg reported on Thursday that the move was meant to improve Malaysia’s rating in the annual Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report by the United States State Department.

“Allegations of human trafficking and money laundering - largely unsubstantiated - have impacted Malaysia’s reputation,” the secretary-general of the human resources ministry, Azman Yusof, wrote in a letter dated Apr 23, which was reviewed by Bloomberg.

In its statement on Thursday, the Human Resources Ministry thanked Bangladesh for recognising Malaysia’s efforts to reform the foreign worker recruitment system and crack down on abuse, following the courtesy call by Asif, the Bangladeshi official who was also accompanied by the special envoy for international affairs Lutfey Siddiqi.

“The Bangladeshi side confirmed that Malaysia was not involved in any of the previously raised allegations and voiced its support for our principled and firm stance against human trafficking,” the statement wrote, as quoted by FMT.

During the meeting between Sim and the Bangladeshi delegation, Sim also stressed that foreign worker recruitment should be driven by genuine industry needs and not for profit.

FMT reported that for more than a decade, the US has said that Malaysia does not meet standards under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, adding that Putrajaya is not making significant and sufficient efforts to rectify the issue.

A low TIP ranking would mean that a country can be restricted from accessing foreign assistance funding from the US or possibly face resistance by US representatives at the International Monetary Fund or other multilateral institutions for access to loans.

In October last year, Bangladeshi authorities had asked the Malaysian government to arrest and extradite two businessmen as part of a probe into alleged money laundering, extortion and trafficking of migrant workers.

They are the founder and associate of a controversial firm managing Malaysia’s migrant worker intake, Bestinet Sdn Bhd.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/malaysia-bangladeshi-migrant-worker-stranded-exploitation-human-trafficking-5134406,2025-05-17T12:58:06Z
channelnewsasia,"‘Not guinea pigs’: Indonesian officials debunk rumours, defend safety of Bill Gates-backed TB vaccine trial","JAKARTA: The late-stage trial of a tuberculosis (TB) vaccine backed by Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and involving over 2,000 Indonesians is safe and will bring benefits to the country, health officials said in the wake of conspiracy theories surrounding the vaccine.

Controversy, including reported rumours and misinformation surrounding the M72/AS01E vaccine candidate, arose after Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto’s remarks following his meeting with American philanthropist and Gates in Indonesia on May 7.

Prabowo said Gates was “developing a TB vaccine for the world” and that Indonesia would be “one of the places to test” the vaccine.

The president also praised Gates’ contributions to the country, noting that his foundation had provided more than US$159 million in grants since 2009, mostly for health programmes.



However, in the wake of Prabowo’s comments, netizens expressed doubts about Indonesia being the “testing ground” for the vaccine candidate. They questioned Gates’ intention and why it was only being tested in “poor countries”.

Indonesia is the only country outside Africa to take part in the trial.

Participating in the trial means Indonesians will be among the first to receive the TB vaccine, said Taruna Ikrar, head of the country’s Food and Drug Supervisory Agency (BPOM), on Wednesday (May 14), as reported by news agency Antara.

Vaccination is one of the most effective strategies to reduce TB prevalence in the country, he said. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the estimated incidence of TB in Indonesia was 387 per 100,000 population in 2023.

Indonesia sees over 1 million TB cases a year and was estimated to have the world’s second-highest number of TB cases in 2023, after India.

It accounted for 10 per cent of an estimated 10.8 million cases globally in 2023, according to the WHO’s Global TB Report 2024. Indonesia recorded about 125,000 deaths from TB in 2023, according to Taruna.

TB is an airborne infectious disease caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and primarily affects the lungs. It can cause lung damage or death if untreated.

The WHO has called M72 the most advanced TB vaccine candidate in development.

Taruna said the vaccine to be trialled is safe, having undergone pre-clinical testing, toxicity studies and safety trials in line with international standards.
“Based on scientific evaluations, we have authorised the clinical trials of the TB vaccine in Indonesia,” he told Antara. “There is no issue here. The TB vaccine will bring many benefits.”

Health Minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin also assured the vaccine is safe.

“This is to educate the public, as well, that we are not guinea pigs,” he reportedly said on May 9.

Rumours about the vaccine were “intentionally spread so that people do not want to be vaccinated. In fact, the consequences can be very fatal, 100,000 people could die because of something like this,” Budi said on May 9.

On Wednesday, Budi said the trial will help determine the vaccine’s compatibility with Indonesia’s population, as vaccine effectiveness can depend on genetic factors, reported news outlet Tempo.

He said the trial involves scientists at Padjadjaran University and the University of Indonesia.

If successful, Indonesia could eventually serve as a manufacturing site for the vaccine, he said.

Dr Windhu Purnomo, an epidemiologist from East Java's Airlangga University, said given the prevalence of the disease in the country, it is important for Indonesia to participate in the quest for a more effective vaccine against TB.

""Currently, the only available vaccine for TB is the BCG vaccine, whose effectiveness in adults is very limited,"" Windhu told CNA, referring to the Bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccine which was developed more than a century ago.

Windhu noted that although Indonesia's 1 million cases a year is lower than India's 2.7 million cases, India's 1.4 billion population is five times that of Indonesia's 281 million.

""This means Indonesia's TB prevalence is higher than India's. Furthermore, in Indonesia one in 10 TB cases resulted in death. That is alarming. Indonesia needs this new vaccine,"" he said.

Windhu dismissed the concerns aired by some Indonesian netizens that the vaccine may not be safe.

""A vaccine's safety is tested during the pre-clinical trial and the first two (phases of) clinical trials. The fact that we are in Phase 3 means that the vaccine is already considered safe and all that is left to test is how effective this vaccine is,” he said.

The M72 is developed by pharmaceutical firm GlaxoSmithKline in partnership with AERAS, a United States-based not-for-profit funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and other organisations.

Indonesia’s involvement in the late-stage trial has been known since last year.

New vaccines are urgently needed to tackle TB in Indonesia and globally, the WHO said in a news release in November 2024 when it convened the first national consultation on new TB vaccines together with Indonesia’s Ministry of Health in Bali.

If M72’s efficacy is confirmed in the late-stage trial, it could lead to the introduction of a new TB vaccine for adults and adolescents by 2030, said the WHO.

The Phase 3 trial involves 20,000 participants from five countries.

Besides the 2,095 people from Indonesia, the rest are from South Africa, Kenya, Malawi and Zambia. Africa had the second-highest number of TB cases in 2023 after Southeast Asia, according to the Global TB Report 2024.

The earlier Phase 2b of the trial involved more than 3,500 people in South Africa, Zambia and Kenya, and results were “cautiously encouraging”, reported an article on May 13 by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, a global health partnership.

“In these adults, who were already thought to have been infected with the bacterium (TB bacteria can remain dormant for many years), the vaccine halved the risk of developing active TB over the next three years compared to a placebo, with an estimated efficacy of 50 per cent,” it reported.

The rumours in Indonesia about M72 are not the first time that conspiracy theories related to public health and Gates have arisen in the country.

In 2023, misinformation about Wolbachia mosquitoes stoked protests and delayed the rollout of a project in Bali that involved their release to fight dengue. The project involved the World Mosquito Programme, which is supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

channelnewsasia,Bangladeshi women rally against gender-based violence,"DHAKA: Around 3,000 women rallied on Friday (May 16) in Bangladesh for the country's interim government to openly support a commission tasked with addressing gender-based violence.

The Women's Affairs Reform Commission was set up by the caretaker government of Nobel Peace prize winner Muhammad Yunus in November as part of its efforts to reform systems established during the iron-fisted rule of former Prime Minister Shiekh Hasina.

Bangladesh's influential coalition of hardline Islamist parties has called for the commission to be abolished, saying the reforms it suggested were against Islamist ideology.

Jannatul Ferdous, a 40-year-old labourer, who took part in the rally, told AFP violence against women had been increasing.



""The situation is worse than it was 16 years ago. The (Islamist) hardliners have gained too much strength,"" she said.

The commission has recommended a uniform family code instead of Muslim family law, which governs inheritance, marriage, divorce and other issues.

The protest was organised in the capital Dhaka by 'Narir Daake Moitree Jatra', a women's movement pressing for equal rights.

""The interim government must fulfil its constitutional role and take action against the reactionary group that is spreading propaganda and misinformation against the reform commission,"" the women's platform said in a statement.

""The reactionary group is using religion as a shield to terrorise people,"" it said.

""We have been witnessing hate campaigns, threats and organised violence. We would like to know who the government is aligning with.""

Hasina was overthrown by student-led mass protests in August 2024 and currently lives in self-imposed exile in India.

Her government was blamed for extensive human rights abuses, and she took a tough stand against Islamist movements during her 15-year rule.

Bangladesh has seen a surge of open support for Islamist groups since her ouster.

channelnewsasia,India asks IMF to reconsider Pakistan programme over 'terror funding',"SRINAGAR, India: Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said on Friday (May 16) the International Monetary Fund (IMF) should reconsider a one billion dollar loan to Pakistan alleging it was ""funding terror"", a move denounced by Islamabad as proof of New Delhi's desperation.

India and Pakistan last week clashed in the worst military violence in decades, killing around 70 people before agreeing a ceasefire that began on Saturday.

The confrontations were sparked by an attack on tourists by gunmen in Indian-administered Kashmir last month that New Delhi accused Islamabad of backing - a charge it denies.

""I believe a big portion of the US$1 billion coming from IMF will be used for funding terror infrastructure,"" Singh told troops at an air force base in western India.



""I believe any economic assistance to Pakistan is nothing less than funding terror.""

Despite India's objections, the IMF last week approved a loan programme review for Pakistan, unlocking a US$1 billion payment which the state bank said has already been received.

A fresh US$1.4 billion loan was also approved under the IMF's climate resilience fund.

India - which also represents Bhutan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh on the IMF board - abstained from the review vote with a statement from its finance ministry stating, ""concerns over the efficacy of IMF programmes in case of Pakistan given its poor track record"".

""India was the lone country which tried to stop it and it failed. It again reflects Indian frustration. Trying to criticise an institution like IMF speaks about this desperation,"" Pakistan's foreign ministry spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan told reporters.

Pakistan came to the brink of default in 2023, as a political crisis compounded an economic downturn and drove the nation's debt burden to terminal levels before being saved by a US$7 billion bailout from the IMF which sparked further crucial loans from friendly nations.

Pakistan, which has long battled militancy within its borders, has faced scrutiny over its ability to combat illicit financing, including to militant organisations and in 2022 was put on an international money-laundering watchlist.

However, the Financial Action Task Force removed Pakistan from it so-called grey-list in 2022 after ""significant progress"" which included charges being filed against suspected militants accused of being involved in the 2008 attacks in India's Mumbai.

Singh claimed it was ""clear that in Pakistan, terrorism and their government are hand in glove with each other.

""In this situation there is a possibility that their nuclear weapons could get their way into the hands of terrorists. This is a danger not just for Pakistan but the entire world,"" he said.

Singh on Thursday called for Pakistan's nuclear arsenal to be put under the surveillance of the UN's atomic energy agency, with Islamabad firing back that the international community should investigate a nuclear ""black market"" in India.

Britain's Foreign Secretary David Lammy met with his Pakistani counterpart Ishaq Dar in Islamabad on Friday, where the two discussed the ceasefire, according to a statement from Pakistan's foreign ministry.

It came as the government also held ceremonies across the country to celebrate the military.

""Pakistan's Armed Forces remain fully prepared and resolutely committed to defending every inch of our territory. Any aggression will be countered,"" Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said while visiting troops on Thursday.

The disputed Muslim-majority region of Kashmir has been at the heart of several wars between the two neighbours, who administer separate portions of the divided territory.

Militants stepped up operations on the Indian side of Kashmir from 2019, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist government revoked the region's limited autonomy and imposed direct rule from New Delhi.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/india-asks-imf-reconsider-pakistan-billion-dollar-loan-terror-funding-5134936,2025-05-17T12:58:06Z
channelnewsasia,Indian climber dies after scaling Everest,"KATHMANDU: An Indian man died after scaling Mount Everest, his expedition organiser said on Friday (May 16), becoming the second fatality of this year's climbing season on the world's highest mountain.

Subrata Ghosh, 45, reached the top of the 8,849m peak on Thursday but died about 50m below the summit while descending.

""It seems he was exhausted and was showing signs of altitude sickness. We are waiting for his guide to return for more details,"" said Bodha Raj Bhandari, of Snowy Horizon Treks and Expedition.

Ghosh was from West Bengal state, which adjoins Bangladesh.



Areas above 8m are known as the ""death zone"" because thin air and low oxygen levels heighten the risk of altitude sickness.

A Filipino climber of the same team died on Wednesday on his way to the summit.

More than 50 climbers have reached the summit since the route opened last week, taking advantage of a brief spell of good weather.

Nepal is home to eight of the world's 10 highest peaks and welcomes hundreds of climbers each spring, when temperatures are warmer and winds are typically calmer.

Last year, more than 800 climbers made it to the peak of Everest, including 74 from the northern Tibet side. Eight people died, including climbers from Nepal, Mongolia, Kenya, the UK and India.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/indian-climber-dies-after-scaling-mount-everest-5134636,2025-05-17T12:58:06Z
channelnewsasia,Vietnam's Vingroup eyes multi-billion dollar high-speed rail project,"HANOI: Vietnam's biggest conglomerate, Vingroup, said on Friday (May 16) it had submitted a proposal to build the country's multi-billion-dollar high-speed railway from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City, with state media reporting the government had welcomed the plan.

The project - which was slated to cost US$67 billion when it was approved in November - is a much-needed boost to infrastructure that is expected to drive growth and enhance Vietnam's reputation among foreign investors.

The line will stretch more than 1,500km from the capital in the north to the country's business hub in the south, and reduce the current journey time by rail from 30 hours to around five.

Vingroup confirmed to AFP on Friday that they had submitted a proposal to the government to build the line.



In a press statement, Vinspeed, a newly established company as part of the Vingroup empire, said the project would cost US$61 billion, and would start in December and be finished by 2030,  five years ahead of the schedule set out last year.

The company said it would commit to mobilising 20 per cent of the total capital, equivalent to US$12.27 billion.

It proposed a zero-interest loan from the state for the remaining 80 per cent, excluding costs related to compensation and resettlement for land clearance.

""We will exert our best efforts ... to develop the project ... (and) pay the loans in due time,"" Dao Thuy Van, deputy director of Vinspeed, said in the statement.

The statement added that Vinspeed's proposal ""will significantly help reduce pressure for the state budget"".

Vietnam's National Assembly had in 2010 scrapped the high-speed project, then estimated at US$56 billion, over fears it was too costly.

Following a meeting on May 12, various ministries and agencies largely welcomed and supported Vingroup's proposal, according to state-controlled newspaper Tuoi Tre.

The government said it wanted to reach a decision before May 22, which would then be submitted to the National Assembly, which is currently in session.

Vingroup, parent group of Nasdaq-listed electric vehicle maker VinFast, is highly powerful in Vietnam, and its business interests span everything from healthcare to real estate and education to tech.

The conglomerate is owned by Vietnam's richest man, Pham Nhat Vuong.

Last month, Vingroup broke ground on a US$9 billion real estate project in a southern coastal area home to a UNESCO-listed mangrove forest.

Communist-run Vietnam has one of the lowest expressway densities in the region, although the country is pushing to expand it, and road transport costs are among the highest.

The country has been an increasingly favoured destination for foreign businesses looking for an alternative to China, but low-quality infrastructure is seen as holding back surging investment.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/vingroup-vietnam-high-speed-railway-ho-chi-minh-city-hanoi-5134456,2025-05-17T12:58:06Z
channelnewsasia,Thai monk arrested over US$9 million temple embezzlement,"BANGKOK: Thai police have arrested a Buddhist monk over allegations that he embezzled more than US$9 million from the prominent temple he ran, which was funded by donations from devotees.

Investigators from the Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) are accusing Abbot Phra Thammachiranuwat from Wat Rai Khing of siphoning more than 300 million baht (US$9.05 million) from the temple's bank account into his own.

Investigators traced funds from the temple on Bangkok's western outskirts to an illegal online gambling network running baccarat card games, local media said.

Temples in Buddhist-majority Thailand rely heavily on income from ""merit-making"" ceremonies where worshippers make donations in hopes of gaining good fortune and better reincarnation.



Police charged Phra Thammachiranuwat with corruption and malfeasance, CIB deputy commissioner Jaroonkiat Pankaew told reporters at a press conference on Thursday (May 15).

""This (arrest) is to help purify our religion,"" Jaroonkiat said.

Authorities have arrested a second suspect and are investigating whether others were involved, while local media reported the abbot has now left the monkhood.

Wat Rai Khing, believed to have been founded in 1851, houses a replica of the Buddha's footprint.

The arrest from one of the Bangkok suburb's most prominent temples has triggered significant backlash on social media.

""Next time I will donate to a hospital or school for good causes, not a temple,"" one user posted on social media platform X.

Others cautioned their fellow Buddhists to remain firm in their faith.

channelnewsasia,"Why India’s farmers are worried about US push to export dairy, grain products","ROHTAK, India: Farmers in India’s rice and wheat belt state of Haryana are worried that imports from the United States will flood the market if agricultural duties are lowered as a result of bilateral trade negotiations.

Washington is pushing to export US dairy and grain products to India, as part of efforts to balance its US$45 billion trade deficit with New Delhi.

But those like wheat and rice farmer Sunil, who prefers to go by one name, said the government should push back on demands to open up the sector.





“Farmers have already been demanding that the government buy our grains at 1.5 times the cost of farming but aren’t getting that price. On top of that, if they lower taxes on US imports, then the local farmers will be finished,” said Sunil.

Farmers in one Haryana village are worried that their problems will only worsen if American grains start flooding the market.

They said an existing oversupply of wheat in the Indian market has made it a struggle in some seasons to sell all the wheat produced.

Indian farmers earn about US$160 each month - or roughly US$1,920 annually - from agriculture and husbandry.

In comparison, the median income of US farmers who are supported by larger land holdings and a more mechanised agricultural system was approximately US$98,000 in 2023, according to US government data.

Sunil said this is why US farm products could have a competitive advantage over Indian farmers.

“Agriculture is a commercial activity for American farmers. For us it’s about sustenance,” he said.

Dairy producers like Sanjay Dalal are also worried about competing with American agricultural imports, which they say could sound the death knell for them.

The owner of Dalal Dairy Farm said he makes US$500 to US$600 in a good month. But during bad times, he barely milks enough from his cattle to break even.

There are 80 million dairy farmers in India, many of them small operators like Sanjay who owns 30 buffaloes.

He said farms like his are already struggling, and that he does not think other farms would survive any competition with US dairy companies.

“America is a rich country. American companies can afford to offer dairy products at cheap rates for a long time to compete with us. And their quality might be fine too,” he added.

US dairy producers have access to tens of billions of dollars in government subsidies annually, while Indian dairy farmers said they receive barely enough assistance to support their businesses.

This uneven playing field is one of the reasons why India imposes import tariffs of up to 60 per cent, which the US says is protectionist.

India also restricts dairy from bovines that eat feed derived from animal products.

This is because Hindus, who make up about 80 per cent of India’s population, consider milk and dairy products to have religious significance.

It is viewed as a staple food item which is also offered to gods during prayers.

Analysts said this means India will unlikely budge on importing such dairy products, despite US pressure.

“There will be uproar at all the levels - cultural level, political level, citizen level. Somehow (the) Indian psyche cannot accept eating butter or milk from a cow that has been fed meat,” said Ajay Srivastava, founder of trade policy think tank Global Trade Research Initiative.

As US President Donald Trump’s administration seeks to finalise a trade deal with India, analysts are expecting concessions across a broad range of sectors including automobiles, pharmaceuticals and steel goods.

But analysts are cautious over any concessions relating to the agricultural sector, which employs about 60 per cent of the country.

Many dairy and wheat farmers said the survival of their businesses is at stake, with supply and demand concerns being a “bread-and-butter” issue that India cannot afford to concede.

Local media have reported that India is wary of broad reductions of tariffs in its agriculture sector amid the ongoing trade talks with the US, fearing such cuts might affect areas vital for the survival of its farmers and small industries.

“It’s not a trade issue for us,” said Ajay.

“It’s (a) livelihood issue for 700 million people and we cannot fiddle with their (lives).”",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/india-us-agriculture-dairy-grains-wheat-tariffs-trade-5134136,2025-05-17T12:58:06Z
channelnewsasia,"Far From Home: Migrant workers from Philippines, Indonesia chase higher wages abroad, but at what cost?","SAN ISIDRO, PHILIPPINES/KUNIRAN, INDONESIA: When Madam Gina Fabiano first considered leaving her wooden home in the Philippines’ Rodriguez municipality to become a domestic worker in Saudi Arabia 7,000km away, her children begged her not to go.

They had never been apart, let alone separated by such great distance for such a long period of time. They would not know how to live their lives without her, they said.

But at the time, the now 43 year-old mother of five - who eventually worked in the Middle East for three years between 2016 and 2019 - felt that she did not have a choice.

Her family’s farmland was becoming increasingly unproductive ever since the government decided to open a landfill nearby in 2002.



Along with other families whose farmlands were also destroyed, Mdm Fabiano and her husband worked as scavengers, sifting through the tonnes of rubbish which originated from the Metro Manila area around an hour away, looking for metals, plastics and other valuables to sell to recycling plants.

The family’s income was never steady. Mdm Fabiano and her husband would earn as little as 1,000 to 2,000 pesos (US$17.10 to US$34.20) a month. The pay was barely enough to put food on the table and pay for her children’s tuition.

Then her mother died in 2016 and Mdm Fabiano, as the second oldest of 14 siblings, had to play the role of matriarch for her brothers and sisters, some of whom were still in school at the time.

“We didn’t have money to take my mother to the hospital when she got sick. I thought at the time that perhaps my mother would not have passed away if I had worked abroad sooner,” Mdm Fabiano told CNA, caressing the cross on her neck with her thumb.

So when the chance came that year to become a domestic worker in Saudi Arabia with a pay of US$400 per month, she jumped at the chance.

In 2016, 2.1 million Filipinos were working abroad, according to data from the Philippines' Department of Migrant Workers. This figure would drop during the pandemic before rising to a new record of 2.3 million in 2023.

The majority of them came from remote rural areas and impoverished urban neighbourhoods such as Rodriguez’s San Isidro district where job opportunities are scarce, especially for people like Mdm Fabiano who only has a junior high school diploma to her name.

Working overseas allowed these Filipinos to earn at least twice the country’s minimum wage of US$10 a day, but it comes with some hefty costs.

For mothers like Mdm Fabiano, working abroad meant losing the chance to watch their children grow up, celebrate special occasions such as birthdays and Christmas as well as missing out on important moments like first days of school and graduations.

For those left behind, it meant losing someone they love, a guardian, a mentor and a shoulder to cry on.

“The most difficult part was I was not able to take care of my only daughter,” Mdm Fabiano said of her youngest child who was still in kindergarten when she left.

“All I could do was call her on my phone and ask: ‘What are you doing now? Did you eat? Are you going to school?’ That’s all. But the girl I took care of in Saudi: I could tie her hair, feed her properly, tuck her to bed.”

“I was able to take care of her but I couldn’t even care for my own kids.”

These latest available numbers were culled from various sources, including past news reports as well official government agencies.

The figures show the number of migrant workers that are currently living and working outside their home countries. While these may include skilled workers, a large proportion of these migrants work in blue-collar industries.

Singapore and Brunei are not included. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Migration Outlook report released in 2022 identified the two countries as among the region’s main destination countries for migrant workers in lower-skilled occupations.

Separately, the total number of overseas migrant workers from Vietnam is unclear, though local media reported that the country aims to send 125,000 workers abroad under contract in 2024. In the first quarter of this year, nearly 36,000 migrant workers from the country went abroad, according to the Ministry of Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs.

Overall, while ASEAN migrant workers take up jobs in many different countries across the world, many choose to work in the region.

For example, a report by the International Labour Organization (ILO) last year said that 1.7 million Myanmar migrant workers were registered in Thailand as of 2023.

“Estimates double when irregular migrants are factored in,” said the ILO report in reference to illegal migrants.

It added that Myanmar nationals make up the largest migrant population in Thailand and represent the largest diaspora population of Myanmar nationals.

And according to Indonesian newspaper Kompas, there were approximately 1.66 million Indonesian migrant workers in Malaysia as of 2022.

Malaysia has long grappled with a large number of illegal migrant workers, with unofficial estimates saying that the figure ranges from 1.2 to 3.5 million.

The influx of illegal Indonesian migrant workers in Malaysia continues to be a thorny topic between both countries.

In June last year, the issue of illegal Indonesian migrant workers was the main agenda at a meeting between the chiefs of the immigration department of the two countries, Bernama reported.

Southeast Asia’s porous borders mean that undocumented migration of people – including workers – remains an issue and contributes to the dangers and vulnerabilities they may face.

In Southeast Asian countries such as the Philippines and Indonesia, emigration abroad to chase better opportunities and wages is common.

The countries’ respective governments and private sectors have taken different approaches to support these itinerant industries. Overseas workers provide a huge contribution to the economy in the Philippines, a country where 15.5 per cent of its 117 million people live below the national poverty line, according to a 2023 data from the Philippine Statistics Authority, and survive on less than US$1.35 per person per day.

Last year, workers overseas sent home US$40 billion, according to the World Bank, contributing to 9.2 per cent of the country’s GDP. The Philippines is the world’s fourth largest recipient of remittances behind India (US$125 billion), Mexico (US$67 billion) and China (US$50 billion).

So important was the outflow of workers to the economy, successive Filipino governments have enacted various policies to promote and support emigration. These policies range from offering better protection to workers overseas to providing programmes to improve the welfare of returning migrant workers.

Former president Rodrigo Duterte, for example, set up the Overseas Filipino Bank to assist migrant workers in sending remittances back to their families in 2018. Three years later, his government established the Department of Migrant Workers to put various government offices linked to labour emigration under one roof.

His successor, Mr Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr, who began his presidency in 2022, has promised to provide migrant workers and their families with health insurance, scholarship grants and a retirement plan.

But critics say these efforts failed to create jobs locally and address the underlying issue of high unemployment rate, which the International Monetary Fund predicted will reach 5.1 per cent this year.

“The majority of overseas workers come from areas where work opportunities are very limited, areas where job security is scarce. Even if they do land a steady job, their salaries are often not enough to meet the basic needs of their families,” Mr Marvin Rimas, secretary general of advocacy group Migrante Philippines, told CNA.

Which is why there are many migrant workers who immediately seek another chance to be employed overseas once they have finished their initial contracts. “There is simply no work for them back home,” Mr Rimas said.

Similarly, most of the 4.8 million Indonesians who are currently working overseas also come from underdeveloped places where work opportunities are limited. But unlike the Philippines, the Indonesian government is not actively promoting emigration.

“The private sector plays a bigger role in getting people to work overseas,” Mr Wahyu Susilo, executive director of advocacy group Migrant Care, told CNA.

The government, he added, plays more of a supervisory and regulatory role for the 443 placement companies registered with the Indonesian Migrant Worker Protection Agency (BPPMI).

These companies often employ freelance brokers who go from one village to the next looking for people who are interested in working abroad.

One such broker, Mr Sutarno, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, said it was initially hard for him to find potential workers when he first started working in the industry back in 1998, at the height of the Asian Financial Crisis.

“Because the rupiah became really weak there were many countries which turned to Indonesia looking for cheap labour,” the 69-year-old told CNA.

Indonesians were losing their jobs because of the financial crisis. But despite this, not many people were interested because the types of work overseas companies were offering at the time were repetitive and backbreaking, such as planting oil palm seeds and construction work.

The low interest meant that Sutarno was only able to recruit 10 people from his own village, Kuniran, in the remote and hilly part of East Java province. But when the first batch of recruits began sending money home, interest spiked almost overnight.

“In just two months, these migrant workers were able to save enough money to buy a brand new motorcycle. In this village, in those days, not even a successful plantation owner could afford to do that in such a short amount of time,” he said.

“Suddenly, everyone wanted to become a migrant worker.”

In Kuniran today, almost every other home has at least one family member with some experience working abroad.

Their houses are easily distinguishable. Those who have not left the village live inside dilapidated traditional homes made out of wood and bamboo.

Meanwhile, those who have gone overseas can afford to build themselves houses made out of brick and concrete, something which was previously accessible only to those who were educated enough to find white collar work in government.

Kuniran is not unique. Across Indonesia, there are many so-called “migrant worker villages” where a huge portion of the working age population is overseas. Combined, these Indonesian workers sent home more than US$11 billion last year, according to the World Bank.

One of the hallmarks of such villages is that they are filled with children cared for by their grandparents or close relatives instead of their own mothers and fathers. While the rest of the year these villages seem quiet and deserted, their populations boom during festivities such as the Islamic holiday Idul Fitri.

The attractive salary abroad, which can be two to three times the country’s average minimum wage of US$190 per month, made many youths in these migrant worker villages aspire to seek work abroad.

The strong interest, however, also attracted tricksters looking to take advantage of naive youths who had never stepped out of their tiny villages, let alone their country.

Migrant Care director, Mr Susilo said he had seen cases where potential migrant workers were told by a middleman to pay up to 3 million rupiah (US$187.73) to apply for a passport, six times what it is supposed to cost.

There are also cases where workers ended up working in another country illegally because they have not secured the necessary permit.

“These workers had never seen a passport before let alone know what a working visa should look like. They only discovered that they have been working using a tourist visa or a temporary visit visa when authorities arrested them,” he said.

Mdm Suparni, a 40-year-old Kuniran resident who also goes by one name, said even from an early age she was aware that there are many tricksters in the industry. But that did not stop her from aspiring to become a migrant worker just like her older sister.

“(My sister) would come home once every two years or so in nice clothes. She would bring me t-shirts, cosmetics and chocolates. She would take my father to a local electronics store where they would buy a new television set or a refrigerator,” the Kuniran native told CNA.

“I thought to myself, ‘that’s what I want to do, I want to work abroad’.”

Mdm Suparni briefly worked as a factory worker in Indonesia after graduating from senior high school but she always set her sights on becoming a migrant worker. That opportunity came in 2006.

She first worked as a labourer at an electronics factory in Malaysia for two years before switching profession to become a member of the housekeeping staff at a hotel in the same country for another year. She then became a domestic helper in Singapore.

After working abroad for five years, Mdm Suparni tried settling down in Indonesia. She returned in 2011, got married a year later and had a daughter in 2014.

But life in Kuniran was hard. Her husband, Mr Kusno, another migrant worker veteran, was making only around 100,000 rupiah a day in construction and jobs were few and far between.

Meanwhile, the only work Mdm Suparni could find was selling vegetables at a local market where she made on average 50,000 rupiah a day.

“We were spending more money than we could earn. We were starting to accumulate debts,” she said.

In 2017, Mdm Suparni made the tough choice of leaving her then two-and-a-half year old daughter, Noni, in the care of her husband and became a domestic helper in Singapore for the second time.

Noni barely recognised her when she came home to visit every few years. Her daughter was more attached to her father and paternal grandmother and barely listened to her mother.

Mdm Suparni, who now works in Taiwan as a domestic worker, said she is still struggling to win her now 10-year-old daughter’s heart.

Noni is sometimes reluctant to speak to her mother whenever she calls and even when the child is in the mood to talk, she will only give short and cold answers.

“I feel like I’m a stranger to her. I want to get close to her but I don’t know how,” Mdm Suparni said.

Cases like this are familiar for Mdm Anis Hidayah, a commissioner at the Indonesian National Commission for Human Rights (Komnas HAM). As a long-time advocate for migrant workers, she has been closely monitoring the impacts migration can have on the families left behind.

The human rights commissioner said that without the structure of a normal family and the love and attention provided by both parents, children sometimes misbehave, perform poorly at school or get into trouble.

“There are many social costs which arise from migration, which I think have not been mitigated well by the government,” she told CNA.

Children in the Philippines are also facing similar issues, said Mr Rimas of advocacy group Migrante Philippines.

“(Migrant workers’) children, they don't have parental guidance, especially from the mother. So the mothers are working abroad and their children experience separation anxiety. They suffer from depression. Then they're looking for something that can cure or lessen their depression,” he said.

Mr Rimas said his group has documented cases where children of migrant workers ended up having drug problems or got into fights at school because they lack the supervision and discipline from both parents.

Although their parents went abroad in the hope that their children can have a better future, ironically it is not uncommon for children of migrant workers to drop out of school as a result of delinquency and bad behaviour.

Ms Maryjane Yago, 19, said her elder sister often used to pick on her, but the bullying got worse after their mother left the Philippines in 2020 to become a domestic worker in Saudi Arabia.

As a result, Ms Yago felt more at home at her friends’ houses. “I would spend the night at my own home maybe twice or three times a week,” she said.

During one of those nights away from home, Ms Yago became pregnant at the age of 17 and as a result did not finish senior high school.

She gave birth to a baby girl, just months before her mother returned to the Philippines in 2023 after a three-year stint working in the Middle East.

“I was in shock at first but in the end I was able to forgive her for what had happened,” Ms Yago’s mother, Mdm Gemma Yago, 47, told CNA. “I do have some regrets about going abroad. If I didn’t go I would be able to take care of my daughters better.”

Like Mdm Gemma Yago, Mdm Fabiano said she also regretted going abroad.

Upset with their mother’s decision to leave, Mdm Fabiano’s children would perform so poorly academically that four of them ended up dropping out of senior high school. Her youngest is still in grade nine and Mdm Fabiano is determined not to let her only daughter follow in her brother’s footsteps.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/migrant-worker-indonesia-philippines-4546536,2025-05-17T12:58:06Z
channelnewsasia,"Far From Home: East Asia drawing more Indonesian and Filipino maids from the Middle East, but will they be treated better?","SRAGEN, Indonesia: When the chance to work as a caregiver in Taiwan came knocking at Madam Wahyuni’s door in early 2024, she thought long and hard about the opportunity.

After four years of being home in her village in the low-lying plains of Central Java, the 40-year-old - who has 10 years of experience working as a domestic helper in Saudi Arabia - said she was initially reluctant to become a live-in worker once more.

“Back home, I can do whatever I like and go wherever I like. You can’t do that anymore if you’re working at someone else’s home,” Mdm Wahyuni, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, told CNA.

More importantly, Mdm Wahyuni said she was still traumatised by her last employer: A 50-year-old Saudi mother of three adult children whom she worked for from 2018 to 2020.



Her former boss, she said, used to make her work 19-hour days with little break or time to herself. She would scold Mdm Wahyuni whenever she thought her domestic helper was working too slowly or for tiny mistakes. She barred her from using the home’s WiFi whenever her employee wanted to have a video chat with her family back home.

But the prospect of earning NT$20,000 (US$631) a month as a caregiver in Taiwan was very lucrative.

It was night and day compared to the 50,000 rupiah (US$3.2) a day she made selling vegetables at a local market back home.

The pay was also higher than the average monthly salary of a maid in Saudi Arabia (US$532), the United Arab Emirates (US$586) and Qatar (US$547).

In May 2024, Mdm Wahyuni made her way to Taipei where she now works as a caregiver to an octogenarian widow and her adult son who has disabilities. Unlike her former employer in Saudi, her new employer has been very kind to her, she said.

Mdm Wahyuni is just one of a growing number of Indonesians working in Taiwan.

In 2017, Indonesia’s Central Bank reported that there were around 208,000 Indonesian migrant workers on the East Asian island. This figure has ballooned to 447,000 in the first half of 2024.

The rise is part of an ongoing trend of workers from the world’s fourth most populous country slowly shifting away from Middle Eastern countries and gravitating towards East Asia.

According to Bank Indonesia, there were 946,000 Indonesian workers in the Middle East in 2024, compared to 1.08 million seven years ago.

In contrast, the number of Indonesian migrant workers employed in East Asia countries and territories such as Taiwan and South Korea has doubled in the same timeframe, going from 450,000 in 2017 to 965,000 this year.

“I heard bad things about working in the Middle East, anything from violence, lack of freedom to unfriendly employers,” said Ms Siti Nabila, a 25-year-old convenience store clerk from Indonesia’s West Java province who is applying to work as a helper in either Hong Kong or Taiwan.

“Many of my neighbours are working in Hong Kong or Taiwan. They said they love working there. They said they have a lot of time off, the salaries are big and the people are friendly.”

More attractive salaries, better labour rights and protection mechanisms, burgeoning demand as well as changes in policy and diplomatic relationships between Indonesia and the recipient countries are some of the main drivers of this shift, experts and migrant worker rights advocates told CNA.

In August, South Korea launched a pilot programme to welcome Filipino workers to the country. Observers say this could be a sign of a wider trend drawing the region’s domestic helpers towards East Asia.

For decades, the top destination countries for Indonesian domestic workers and caregivers have been Middle Eastern countries such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, particularly as the economies of these Gulf states skyrocketed during the oil price boom of the 1970s.

But the International Labour Organisation noted that some of these countries are notorious for offering little protection towards domestic workers. Migrant helpers in these Arab states were often excluded from the countries’ respective labour laws and tied to their employers through a restrictive sponsorship system known as kafala, the United Nations body reported.

The system involves binding a worker to a specific employer throughout their stay in a particular country, giving the employer considerable power over the helpers’ working and living conditions.

Under the system, the workers are barred from switching jobs and can even face arrest for running away or trying to leave the country without their employers’ consent.

Various human rights groups have argued that the kafala system has paved the way for a culture of impunity among abusive employers since domestic workers were unable to leave their employers and report the abuses that they endured.

“Because of the sponsorship system, many workers have no choice but to stay with their employer despite experiencing physical abuse, harsh living conditions or working for more than 18 hours (a day),” Madam Anis Hidayah, a commissioner at the Indonesian National Commission on Human Rights, told CNA.

Throughout the decades, there have been numerous reported cases of foreign domestic helpers, including dozens of Indonesians, who were sexually assaulted or physically abused. These cases sometimes led to deaths, disabilities and disfigurement, stoking anger and demonstrations back home.

Madam Surani, who worked in Saudi Arabia from 1995 to 2020, when she returned to Indonesia, said her last Saudi employer was initially nice to her when she started working for her in 2016.

But that started to change when her employer's husband left her for another woman in 2018. A year later, her employer got into a bitter dispute with her siblings over the family’s inheritance.

“(She) became short tempered. She once hurled a plate at me and threatened to kill me for no reason,” the Indonesian helper, who also goes by one name, said.

For two months in 2020, she was locked in her room and was only allowed to go out whenever the employer needed her to do some house chores.

“I was only fed two slices of bread a day,” the 49-year-old told CNA.

After two months of being locked up in her room, Mdm Surani sought help from the Indonesian consulate in Jeddah which contacted the local authorities. They helped her return home.

“I was taken to the Indonesian consulate’s shelter. There, I met maids who were beaten up. Two of them were completely paralysed. One had bleach thrown at her face which damaged her eyesight,” she said.

“And these are just cases from Jeddah.”

In 2015, the Indonesian public was outraged by the execution of several Indonesian helpers for killing their employers in Saudi Arabia, which Indonesia saw as self-defence because the maids were abused.

Over the years, the mistreatment of domestic workers in the Middle East has created a number of diplomatic rows between countries which send domestic workers abroad, such as Indonesia and the Philippines, and host countries such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.

Cases of abuse and injustice affecting domestic workers from Southeast Asia sometimes sparked widespread public outrage at home. These cases typically resulted in Indonesia or the Philippines lodging formal protests.

However, in 2011, Jakarta took things to the next level by recalling its then-ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Gatot Abdullah Mansyur in response to the execution of an Indonesian domestic worker, Ruyati Sapubi who was accused of killing her employer.

Indonesia maintained that it was only notified of the execution after Mdm Ruyati was beheaded, depriving its diplomats of their ability to protect her.

Indonesia-Saudi relations normalised and the Indonesian ambassador was redeployed to Riyadh just a few days later, after the Arab kingdom issued a formal apology and promised to review the cases against 12 Indonesian maids who were also on death row at the time.

However, instances of Indonesian domestic workers executed in Saudi Arabia for killing their employers continued after the normalisation. Jakarta felt that these domestic workers should not have received the death penalty, arguing that the killings were self-defence because the maids were abused.

In 2015, Indonesia imposed a moratorium on the sending of domestic workers to Saudi Arabia along with 18 other countries in the Middle East and North Africa.

Meanwhile, the Philippines and Kuwait engaged in a diplomatic row in 2018 after the death of a Filipina maid, Joanna Demafelis whose lifeless body was discovered inside a freezer in her employer’s apartment, more than a year after she was reported missing. The death sparked a widespread public outcry in the Philippines.

Then-president Rodrigo Duterte responded by ordering a ban on the sending of new domestic workers to Kuwait in February of 2018.

The row turned into a full-blown diplomatic crisis in May after the Filipino embassy in Kuwait aided the escape of three citizens who were abused and held captive by their respective employers.

Manila acknowledged that the rescue operations were not coordinated with Kuwaiti authorities but argued that the maids’ lives were threatened and their cries for help needed to be acted upon immediately.

Kuwait responded by expelling Philippine Ambassador to Kuwait Renato Villa and issuing an arrest warrant against several embassy personnel for violation of its sovereignty.

Both sides decided to normalise relations several weeks later after the Philippines agreed to lift its ban while Kuwait agreed to provide more rights and benefits to domestic workers such as health insurance and a weekly day off.

Despite the rows, relationships between Southeast Asia and Middle Eastern countries in other sectors were largely unaffected.

Indonesia and Saudi Arabia, for example, remained key partners in trade and investment even when the former imposed the eight-year ban on sending new domestic workers to the Gulf state.

Indonesia, the world’s most populous Muslim-majority country, also continued to send more and more worshipers for the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia’s Mecca and Medina.

Meanwhile, the Philippines and Kuwait continued to be key trading partners in the sectors of oil and gas, apparel and fruits despite the diplomatic crisis.

In response to the executions, Indonesia that year imposed a moratorium on sending new migrant workers - including domestic helpers and caregivers - to individual employers in 19 countries in the Middle East and North Africa, including Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

The moratorium did not include Indonesian domestic helpers who were already in these countries, like Mdm Surani.

“We were hoping that with the moratorium, recipient countries would make improvements in the protection (of Indonesian workers),” Mr Judha Nugraha, director of protection of overseas Indonesians at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told CNA.

The number of Indonesian workers dropped by around 150,000 during the eight-year moratorium, which was partially lifted in 2023. However, experts and activists noted that during the period, there were thousands who circumvented the ban.

“The number of undocumented workers (in the Middle East) skyrocketed,” said Mdm Anis of the Indonesian Human Rights Commission. “Their status (as undocumented workers) made them even more vulnerable to mistreatment, abuse and exploitation.”

The moratorium forced Gulf states to look elsewhere to recruit helpers and caregivers and the Philippines was one of the countries which capitalised on the situation.

Saudi Arabia and the UAE have always been the top two destination countries for overseas Filipino workers. But their figure has gone up drastically over the last 20 years, according to annual studies by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA).

In 2004, the PSA estimated that there were around 282,000 Filipino workers in Saudi Arabia and 104,000 in the UAE. Last year, these figures rose to 432,000 and 293,000 respectively.

Meanwhile, Kuwait and Qatar have been among the top five destination countries for overseas Filipino workers over the last four years, overtaking Singapore and Japan. According to PSA data, last year there were 140,000 Filipinos working in Kuwait and 134,000 in Qatar while there were 97,000 in Japan and 84,000 in Singapore.

The influx of Filipinos working in the Middle East was not without consequence.

Citing figures from the Philippine Overseas Labor Office, Philippine Daily Inquirer wrote that in 2020 of the nearly 5,000 cases of maltreatment of Filipino workers around the world, 4,300 came from the Gulf States.

The 2020 figure, presented during a senate hearing, was the only time such data was made public. However, numerous media reports of distressed Filipinos in the Middle East indicate that the wave of maltreatment has continued over the years.

Madam Joy Rama, 31 said she was constantly scolded by her employer for little to no reason during her time as a domestic worker in Jeddah between October 2023 and June of 2024.

“They accused me of not doing my job. When I tried to explain myself, I got scolded for talking back to them. My madam would even throw things at me. Once she twisted my arm,” the Filipina woman told CNA.

For months, Mdm Rama repeatedly begged her employer to let her return home.

“When she finally decided to let me go, the whole family surrounded me and made me sign a piece of paper written in Arabic. I was so scared for my life and so desperate to go home, I signed it,” she said.

“I am still owed two and half months worth of salary. Perhaps, that was what the document was all about.”

Mr Angelo Jimenez, the president of the University of the Philippines and a government advisor on migrant worker affairs, said the Philippines is doing all it can to put an end to the wave of abuse.

“At the core of every case is power imbalance,” Mr Jimenez told CNA. “We are thinking: How can we empower the powerless?”

Among the measures taken by the Philippines was a moratorium on the sending of new domestic workers to Kuwait in 2018 and Saudi Arabia between 2021 and 2022.

These bans were lifted after the two Arab countries agreed to provide more protection to Filipino workers such as the ability for helpers to terminate their contracts if they are abused or not paid.

Responding to allegations of abuse towards domestic workers, a UAE spokesperson told the Guardian in 2023: “The UAE maintains a zero-tolerance policy towards workplace abuse.”

He added that the country has also organised workshops aimed at domestic workers so they understand their rights and how to report abuse.

A Qatari government spokesperson told the same newspaper in April that there have been a number of legal reforms in the past decade, including allowing migrant workers to change jobs without their employers’ consent and setting a higher monthly minimum wage of QAR 1000 (US$275) in 2020, up from QAR 906.

When Indonesia partially lifted its moratorium last year after improvements in domestic worker’s rights in a number of Gulf States, among the positive steps praised by activists was Saudi Arabia’s decision in 2022 to allow domestic workers to switch employers if they are abused or have their wages withheld.

The following year, the kingdom passed a law which mandates employers to give at least eight hours of uninterrupted rest daily and a weekly day off which lasts no less than 24 hours. The new law took effect on Sep 21, 2024.

Meanwhile, the UAE promised to include all domestic workers in the country’s compulsory health insurance scheme starting next year.

Despite these improvements, Indonesia is still cautious about fully lifting its ban and allowing private agencies to deploy domestic workers to the Middle East on their own. Currently, all Indonesian helpers have to be deployed through government-controlled arrangements.

“There is a pilot project between Indonesia and Saudi (Arabia) where the kafala sponsor is not an individual but a legal entity. We have evaluated (the project) and generally the protection system is much better,” Mr Judha of the Indonesian foreign ministry said.

He declined to say when or if Indonesia will fully lift the ban.

Mr Wahyu Susilo, executive director of Jakarta-based advocacy group Migrant Care said Indonesia should not be hasty about ending the moratorium.

“The new laws (adopted by Middle Eastern countries) are steps in the right direction but we have yet to see how these laws will be enforced,” he told CNA.

Around the same time as Indonesia’s moratorium on sending migrant workers to the Middle East, Taiwan started recruiting more foreign workers to care for its burgeoning elderly population.

According to Taiwan’s National Development Council the number of citizens aged 65 and over has doubled to 4.2 million in the last 22 years. Taiwan, which has a population of more than 23 million, is expected to become a “super-aged society” by 2025.

In 2015, Taiwan relaxed the eligibility of residents looking to hire live-in foreign caregivers to any person more than 80 years of age. Before, a doctor’s certificate was needed before a household could hire a live-in caregiver.

Last year, the eligibility was further expanded to those with conditions such as dementia and mental or physical disabilities.

Indonesia, one of Taiwan’s largest trading partners, was able to capitalise on these relaxations. Today, 65 per cent of around 250,000 social welfare workers, which include domestic workers and caregivers, in Taiwan are Indonesians.

But experts said that domestic workers and caregivers in Taiwan are prone to exploitation in the form of long working hours, heavy workload as well as violence and harassment since they are not protected under Taiwan’s labour laws due to the informal nature of their work.

The only thing protecting helpers and caregivers are the terms stipulated in their respective employment contracts which can vary significantly between one contract to the next.

“I am only entitled to one rest day per month while most of my friends got one rest day every week,” Indonesian helper Madam Suparni told CNA of her fellow domestic workers in Taiwan who managed to cut a better deal with their employers.

The 40-year-old, who goes by one name, said after four months of working in Taiwan, the lack of rest days is starting to affect her physical and mental health.

Then there’s the issue of her living arrangement. Because space is at a premium in her city, Taipei, Mdm Suparni is forced to sleep on an inflatable mattress inside a cockroach-infested storage room. The only other space where she can have her privacy is the apartment’s balcony which is primarily used for drying clothes.

Taiwan is currently deliberating a “Domestic Workers Protection Act,” which would entitle domestic workers to at least one day off per week. The act also includes provisions on wage standards, rest time, leaves and insurance.

According to local media, the bill, which was first drafted in 2011, has been going back and forth between branches of the government due to concerns on how to implement it.

But still, helpers and caregivers are impervious to unfair treatments and abuse in these emerging host countries due to the informal and isolated nature of their work.

“Even the strictest of labour laws cannot control what goes on in the privacy of an employers’ home,” Mdm Anis of the Indonesian Commission on Human Rights said.

The Philippines is also seeing more of its citizens working in East Asia.

In August, South Korea welcomed 100 Filipino workers as part of its pilot programme to allow for the first time, foreign workers to work for Korean families as domestic helpers and caregivers.

If the six-month pilot is deemed successful, the Seoul Metropolitan Government plans to bring in 500 Filipino caregivers next year, and up to 1,000 by 2028.

The workers will be paid the country’s minimum wage of 9,860 won (US$7) an hour. For 40 hours of work per week, that adds up to about US$1,800 a month including mandatory insurance coverage.

The Korea Times reported that the Filipino workers will work part-time at multiple households, citing a survey conducted by the Ministry of Employment and Labour which shows that there is more demand for part-time helpers who are able to work for about four hours a day and three to four days a week, rather than those who live with their employers.

The ministry, the newspaper wrote, is offering a dormitory for these workers in cooperation with the Seoul Metropolitan Government.

Like Taiwan, South Korea is expected to become a “super-aged society” next year with 20 per cent of the 51 million population are aged 65 or older.

The country is also facing a declining birthrate which last year stood at 0.72 births per woman. The programme aims to encourage more women to have children by easing the burden of childcare responsibilities through the hiring of foreign helpers.

But the initiative has faced resistance from activists and politicians who see the presence of foreign caregivers as competition to South Korea’s own domestic worker labour force, which is estimated to be 107,000 according to Statistics Korea.

Japan is also mulling allowing foreigners to become in-home caregivers to alleviate an acute labour shortage in the field.

Currently, foreigners can only work in nursing homes and are barred from providing home care, due to concerns about their Japanese communication skills and understanding of its culture and tradition.

Mr Marvin Rimas, secretary general of advocacy group Migrante Philippines said the rising demand for domestic workers and caregivers in East Asia could be the start of a trend for Filipino workers to also shift away from the Middle East in favour of working in East Asia.

“The only reason why the Middle East is very popular among overseas Filipino workers is because getting a job there is easy. There are fewer requirements in terms of education, certification or experience. But abuse is rampant there,” he told CNA.

The Philippines, he said, is trying to improve the skills of its workforce to meet the qualifications needed by countries like Taiwan and South Korea.

“Demand for foreign workers in these countries will likely keep growing. And interests among Filipinos to work in these countries is very high,” he said.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/indonesia-philippines-domestic-workers-shift-middle-east-east-asia-4641676,2025-05-17T12:58:06Z
channelnewsasia,"Far From Home: Through choppy seas and porous land borders, migrant workers risk it all to enter Malaysia. Why?","BATAM/KUALA LUMPUR: It was the height of the rainy season in 2021 when Mr Nurdan found himself carrying an unconscious stranger on his shoulder as he made his way across muddy grounds to a densely vegetated forest somewhere in the eastern coast of Johor.

The wooden barge that the Indonesian and some 60 others of his countrymen had used to enter Malaysia illegally had been battered by the angry seas that evening.

To make matters worse, one of its engines had stalled before the vessel crashed into some jagged rocks about 50m from the shoreline, forcing them to swim to safety.

Mr Nurdan recalled that he was still in shock from the accident and exhausted from swimming for his life. He did not know where he was and where to go.



“But all I could think about was: ‘Don’t get caught’,” the 37-year-old, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, told CNA.

He had best get out of the beach and look for a place to hide, Mr Nurdan thought. Authorities, he predicted, would soon discover the marooned barge and swarm the beach looking for survivors to round up.

If caught, undocumented migrants like Mr Nurdan can face a penalty of up to five years in prison and six strokes of the cane.

Which is why Mr Nurdan was petrified when several cars drove up to the beach a few hours into his hiding, thinking that they were Malaysian authorities.

But they turned out to be the undocumented migrants’ Malaysian contacts, ready to transport them to a safe house in the city of Johor Bahru.

Mr Nurdan and the recently revived stranger he had rescued emerged from their hiding as did dozens of others who were on the same boat. But not everyone was there by the time the contacts arrived, Mr Nurdan recounted.

“One of my friends was not there and so was the woman who gave me a cup of coffee before we set sail,” he said. Mr Nurdan would not hear from either of them since.

Over the years, hundreds have lost their lives making the perilous sea journeys from Indonesia’s Riau and Riau Islands provinces to the southern Malaysian states of Johor and Melaka.

Many more were intercepted by Indonesian and Malaysian authorities patrolling the vast waters surrounding the two countries and charged with immigration offences.

But the risk of drowning and arrests have failed to dissuade thousands of these migrants from looking to land a job illegally in Malaysia every year.

During a trip to Batam in August, CNA tried to recreate what these journeys were like and sailed on a similar wooden boat as far as possible without leaving Indonesian waters.

The wind was blowing hard that day and the sea was already choppy by the time our boat set sail from a fishing port in the southeastern side of Batam.

Along the way, the skipper, Mr Bidin pointed to tiny unmanned islets where migrant worker boats were launched and landed.

“A few months ago, I spotted eight migrant workers there, hiding in the bushes and behind the trees,” Mr Bidin told CNA, pointing to a deserted island about a five minute boat ride away from the fishing port.

Minutes later, the skipper directed our attention to another islet. “The Navy once intercepted a migrant worker boat around that island a few years ago,” he said.

It took the boat around 40 minutes to reach the Singapore Strait, by that time the current had become stronger and the waves bigger from the steady stream of giant container ships sailing by.

From there, Johor’s industrious Pengerang municipality, with its rows of flame towers from the oil refineries and petrochemical plants in the area, were in clear view and was just a 45 minute boat ride away.

Aside from the sea route, these undocumented migrants have also entered the Southeast Asian country by land, taking advantage of Peninsular Malaysia’s porous border with Thailand and Eastern Malaysia’s border with Indonesia’s West and North Kalimantan provinces on Borneo island.

The World Bank estimates that there were 1.2 to 3.5 million undocumented migrants in Malaysia between 2018 and 2020, mainly those who hail from Indonesia, Bangladesh and Myanmar.

Meanwhile, the number of documented migrants during the same period were around 1.4 to 2 million.

Most migrant workers in Malaysia work in labour-intensive sectors such as construction, agriculture and manufacturing as well as occupations considered to be dirty, dangerous or demeaning, better known as 3D jobs.

But living as an undocumented migrant worker comes with a hefty price to pay.

They live in constant fear that one day Malaysian authorities would raid their lodgings or workplaces, arrest them for immigration offences and deport them back to their respective countries.

Some of the undocumented migrant workers have also said that they were prone to abuses, unfair treatment as well as unpaid wages from their employers who can easily call in the police on them if they dare to speak up in protest.

And yet thousands would rather risk their lives and freedom for a chance to make three to five times the pay they receive back home even after they are caught and deported multiple times.

“Many have been deported back (to Indonesia) only to reenter (Malaysia) illegally. Once in Malaysia, they get arrested again and deported again,” Mr Imam Riyadi of the Indonesian Migrant Worker Protection Agency (BP2MI) - a government agency tasked with overseeing the deployment and protection of the country's migrant workers - told CNA.

“It is like an endless cycle.”

Mr Imam of BP2MI said there are a plethora of reasons as to why someone from Indonesia would want to become an undocumented worker in neighbouring Malaysia beyond their similar culture and languages.

“Some people just don’t want to go through the proper channel (to legally work in Malaysia) because they think the process is too long or because they are not qualified,” the chief of the agency’s Riau Islands office said.

According to its website, applicants need to carry at least 11 different documents if they wish to become a migrant worker, including a statement from the local police saying that they have never been under investigation or convicted of any crime.

Aside from these documents, hopefuls also need to undergo medical and psychological evaluations as well as participate in professional and language training courses related to their line of work and destination country.

Indonesian migrant workers and rights groups interviewed by CNA said the whole process can take between two and four months.

“Going through proper government channels and training centres, meeting all the requirements to obtain these documents, according to (some workers) takes a long time,” Mr Irwan Setiawan, the co-founder of Batam-based anti-trafficking group Embun Pelangi, told CNA.

“The government needs to simplify the process to stop people from embarking on these perilous journeys and becoming prey to people smuggling syndicates.”

Then there are those like Mr Nurdan who went to Malaysia when the country closed its borders to stop the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Meanwhile, there are others who originally went to work in Malaysia legally but had since been barred from reentering the country after being deported due to offences.

Mr Syamsul Hadi, 28, said he first came to Malaysia in 2013 to work as a labourer at an oil palm plantation in Malaysia’s Selangor state. “It was backbreaking work and the pay was not worth it,” he told CNA.

Four months before his two-year contract ended, Mr Syamsul left the company in secret and found work at an illegal gambling den in Kuala Lumpur.

By law, a foreign worker is not allowed to switch employers during the duration of their stay permit and can be blacklisted by the country’s immigration department for absconding.

And so when the gambling den was raided in 2016, Mr Syamsul was deported to Indonesia and barred from setting foot in Malaysia ever again.

Mr Syamsul said he tried to find work in his hometown in Lombok. “But the pay was nothing compared to Malaysia,” he said. Mr Syamsul reentered Malaysia in 2017, this time illegally by sea in a journey that he said took him around two hours.

Like Mr Syamsul, Mr Jaspal (not his real name) was blacklisted from Malaysia under similar circumstances: Absconding from his first employer whom he claims did not pay him his wages.

For four years, the 32-year-old - who hails from Punjab in northern India - was working without proper documentation, doing various informal jobs for an employer who was in the agricultural business in the town of Rawang, Selangor.

While the minimum pay in Malaysia is fixed at RM1,500 (US$342) per month, Mr Jaspal said that in some good months he can earn up to RM2,500 monthly, depending on commissions.

In 2022, he took advantage of an immigration department’s repatriation programme that allowed undocumented migrants in the country to leave for a fine of RM500 as he missed home.

Mr Jaspal told CNA that he tried to find work in India but the pay was a mere pittance for someone who does not have any educational qualifications. It was a far cry compared to his days in Malaysia where he could earn five times as much doing the same job.

“I felt I had no choice but to come back. It really wasn’t an easy decision to come here again,” he said, adding that he had secured a job with his previous employer prior to his return.

As he was blacklisted from entering the country, Mr Jaspal took another route to enter Malaysia in 2023. This time, he booked a flight to Bangkok, Thailand before entering Malaysia illegally by land via a bus.

He paid about RM4,000 to an agent.

While Mr Jaspal admitted that he does not know the route in which the bus had taken him, he managed to enter Malaysia without getting his passport stamped, adding that he was on the bus the whole time and did not get out to pass through any immigration land crossings.

The journey to the border with some migrants from India as well as those from other countries took about 20 hours altogether.

He has heard of some other migrants who have had to cross rivers to get into Malaysia.

On Nov 5, the Kelantan state government announced that it would propose the construction of a 100km wall along the Malaysia-Thailand border to the federal government.

About a week later, Home Minister Saifuddin Nasution said the wall was still at the proposal stage. But it has since been reported that Thailand has agreed to the plan to build the security and flood wall along the Golok River that lies on the border of the two countries.

Malaysia's Inspector-General of Police Razarudin Husain was reported as saying by Bernama that a wall would help the authorities curb cross-border criminal activities.

Meanwhile, it is not known if the people smuggling Mr Jaspal into Malaysia had bribed Thai and Malaysian officials for a safe passage across the border.

But a report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime earlier in March on migrant smuggling in Southeast Asia said such corrupt practices are common in the region as in other places around the world.

Now a lorry driver in Kuala Lumpur, Mr Jaspal said many of his friends have been detained at various depots run by the immigration department and has heard of the harrowing accounts of the conditions of abuse at these facilities.

Every morning before venturing out for work, Mr Jaspal said he offers a silent plea to God: That he evades the authorities.

He claims that he has offered bribes during the times he has been stopped by enforcement officers, so as to not get locked up.

These days, Mr Jaspal added that his drives are restricted to locations nearby because of the recent intense raids against undocumented migrants by the immigration department.

“I have learned to become more careful and alert of my surroundings. If I have a choice, I would still like to go home and be with my family, but it just isn’t possible at the moment. I can only take it one day at a time,” said Mr Jaspal, who wants to get married and settle down back home one day.

Meanwhile, those who enter Malaysia by sea also have to pay the so-called “beach money” on top of their boat ride.

People interviewed by CNA said they saw cash changing hands from the people smuggling syndicate organising the trip to land owners or residents in Indonesia where their boats were launched and in Malaysia where they landed.

Based on media reports on where these boats were intercepted and raided, these migrant workers would set sail from empty beaches in Batam’s Nongsa area or the many unmanned islets dotting the waters between Batam and Bintan.

Meanwhile in Malaysia, migrant boats are frequently intercepted off the coast of Johor’s Pontian in the West, Teluk Ramunia in the South and Tanjung Balau in the East.

These locals are paid to keep their mouth shut and inform the smugglers of any police or coast guard presence.

“Sometimes these residents would extort money from the workers as well. They’ll frisk your pocket and go through your stuff in search of cash. If we resist, they threaten to call the cops on us,” Mr Syamsul said, adding that he paid these Indonesian and Malaysian locals a total of RM300 on top of the 7 million rupiah (US$443) he spent for the boat ride.

But no amount of money can guarantee a safe passage at sea.

According to the International Organization for Migration, more than 4,000 fatalities have been recorded annually on migratory routes worldwide, around 60 per cent of which was caused by drowning.

The number of deaths recorded, however, is the tip of the iceberg because the majority of migrant deaths around the world go unrecorded.

Accidents involving overloaded boats carrying migrant workers are rampant along the waterways between Indonesia and Malaysia, particularly since people smugglers like to operate at night.

Although it helps to avoid detection, sailing in the dark makes it hard for skippers and their crew to spot incoming waves, shallow reefs and jagged rocks.

In December 2021, one of these boats capsized off the coast of Tanjung Balau amid stormy weather, leading to at least 19 Indonesian migrants killed.

CNA spoke to an official from the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency, an arm of the Ministry of Home Affairs who does navy patrols across the country.

The official, who is part of the agency’s Tanjung Sedili division which patrols waters along the coast of southeast Johor, including off Tanjung Balau, told CNA that these migrants typically travel not only during late night or during the wee hours of the morning, but also amid stormy weather when there is “perceived less” chance of being intercepted by patrol boats.

“Because they travel when the waves are choppy, like during the year-end monsoon season, they are at risk of these accidents and many have lost their lives,” said the official who declined to be named.

He added that the incident in 2021 was the worst he has seen in the last decade.

Even if they made it to Malaysian soil, these undocumented migrants have to constantly look over their shoulders.

They are more prone to abuse, harsh working conditions and unfair treatment compared to those with permission to work legally in the country.

“Illegal workers are helpless,” said Mr Ari Yulianto, a 40-year-old Indonesian who worked odd jobs in Malaysia from 2002 to 2020 before taking advantage of a Malaysian repatriation programme during the COVID-19 pandemic to return home.

“For example, if we were promised a pay of RM100 ringgit (a day) and they only gave us 15-25 ringgit, there was nothing we could do. We wouldn’t dare protest. They might call the police and we are done for.”

When this happens, the only way out is to look for another job, Mr Ari told CNA.

Which is why during his 18 years in Malaysia the Indonesian man switched employers seven times and had a wide variety of jobs from construction worker to plantation labourer and even as a hotel cleaner.

Employers, meanwhile, can face lengthy jail sentences and lofty fines if they are caught hiring undocumented workers. Which is why many workplace injuries went unreported.

Mr Kiman, a 52-year-old Indonesian who also goes by one name, said he had to suffer in silence after his right foot was crushed by a wheelbarrow filled with oil palm fruits in 2016.

Because Mr Kiman was an undocumented worker who came to Malaysia illegally in 2002, his company in Sabah refused to take him to the hospital.

“The doctors at the plantation clinic simply dressed the wound and gave me some paracetamol,” he told CNA.

Over time the wound had become infected and Mr Kiman was feverish. “I even found some maggots eating away my flesh.”

After about a week since the accident, the company decided to give Mr Kiman some money and drove him to the Indonesian border so the man could seek proper help at an Indonesian hospital.

By that time, the wound had become so bad, doctors in Indonesia had to amputate three of his toes.

Despite these conditions, millions continue to work in Malaysia illegally. Part of the reason is because some Malaysian employers actually prefer to hire undocumented workers due to a variety of factors.

According to the Malaysian Employers Federation (MEF), some business owners take the risks of employing undocumented workers out of desperation.

MEF's president, Dr Syed Hussain Syed Husman, told CNA that when guidelines and regulations on employment of foreign workers change frequently, employers do not find these changes easy to comply with.

At the same time, they urgently need workers to run their businesses.

“When hiring foreign workers takes a very long time before the worker arrives in Malaysia from the source countries, it is impossible to wait. And even when there was a regularisation program to streamline the documentation of undocumented workers, the processes and procedures were too tedious,” said Dr Syed.

He added that it takes months to apply and obtain approval for the workers, with the turnaround time sometimes being even more than 18 months.

“The quota system in the allocation of foreign workers is not reflective of the needs of employers,” said Dr Syed, adding that among the sectors that face shortage of workers include manufacturing, construction, agriculture, plantation, and services.

Waste disposal business owner Raghav (not his real name) said that not many locals are interested in his line of work where weekends are almost non-existent.

“Most locals who try this work cannot seem to last for more than a week,” he told CNA.

Without a proper office, Mr Raghav said he finds it tough to meet the requirements to employ foreign workers legally.

Which is why he claims that he has no choice but to employ undocumented foreign workers or foreign workers who have legal papers but were not authorised to work with him.

“It is a risk but one that I have to take,” said Mr Raghav, who declined to give his real name for fear of repercussions from the authorities.

Meanwhile, a provider of security guards to various places in Petaling Jaya, Selangor who wanted to be known only as Imran told CNA that it is hard to get locals and workers with permits to fill in empty positions.

“I am willing to pay them RM2,000 per month but local workers come and go,” he said.

Mr Imran admitted to previously hiring undocumented migrants but stopped after some of his friends were caught by the police.

“I think it’s not worth the hassle,” he said, adding that he himself has to step in to work at times because of the staff shortage.

By law, Malaysian employers can face up to 12 months in prison and a fine of between RM10,000 to 50,000 for each undocumented worker they employ.

In August, the immigration department’s director-general Ruslin Jusoh told a press conference that 900 employers had been detained so far this year for employing undocumented workers.

After three years of living in Malaysia as an undocumented worker, the law finally caught up with Mr Nurdan.

The plantation he was working at in Selangor was raided by immigration officials earlier this year and Mr Nurdan was taken to an immigration detention facility where he spent four months in custody.

Months before, Mr Syamsul was also arrested by Malaysian authorities in a separate raid in Melaka. Because he has been deported once before, Mr Syamsul was given a harsher sentence of nine months in prison.

The two were deported to Batam in August and were immediately taken to a BP2MI shelter.

Both Mr Nurdan and Mr Syamsul had their passports and Indonesian identity cards confiscated by agency officials.

“We sent their passports and identity cards to the address listed in their documents,” BP2MI Riau Islands chief Mr Imam said.

He admitted that sending documents to deportees’ respective villages is not a foolproof way to prevent these workers from making the perilous journey again.

“At least this way, they have no choice but to go back home first. Otherwise, they would just stay in Batam and look for their way in (to Malaysia) again,” he said.

Mr Imam said with every year his shelter welcomes around a thousand deportees - some like Mr Syamsul were repeat offenders. “We had one woman who went in and out of Malaysia illegally six times,” he said.

The agency also works together with the local police force to launch an investigation against people smugglers aiding these undocumented workers.

“Their testimonies have been very useful in bringing down these traffickers,” Riau Islands Provincial Police spokesman Zahwani Pandra Arsyad told CNA.

Over the years, these testimonies had led to the raid of several houses in Batam which were frequently used by people smuggling rings to shelter would-be undocumented workers and the arrest of dozens of suspected traffickers.

Malaysia’s Home Ministry did not respond to CNA’s request for comments but media reports suggest that the country is also stepping up its raids on undocumented workers.

In the first week of January alone, some 200 immigration raids were carried out in the capital Kuala Lumpur. Hundreds, including their employers, were detained.

More recently, hundreds of officers from various Malaysian agencies conducted a two-hour raid in Selangor targeting shop houses and businesses, New Straits Times reported last month.

Some 602 people were detained on suspicion of violating various immigration offences.

Mr Irwan of anti-trafficking group Embun Pelangi said these raids do not address the root causes of the problem: Complicated red tapes to become legal migrant workers as well as employers’ difficulty to hire them.

“Some people become undocumented workers because the process to become legal migrant workers is too complicated and lengthy,” he said.

“(Hiring undocumented workers) is also easier for employers. (Undocumented workers) can just come and immediately start working in their plantations without needing to pay government fees. They just need to pay the smugglers.”

Mr Syamsul said having been convicted twice with immigration offences has made him reluctant about going back to Malaysia.

“If I go and get arrested again, surely my sentence would be much harsher,” he said. “For now, I just want to find work here in Indonesia.”

Mr Nurdan said it was his ordeal at sea instead of his time at the Malaysian detention centre that made him think twice about entering Malaysia illegally again.

“I know it is a long shot since I am now blacklisted, but if there is a way for me to come to Malaysia legally, I would,” he said, adding that for now, he will go back to his village and tend the family’s farmland.

“I will not take the sea route again. It’s too risky.”

channelnewsasia,Far From Home: Why do Southeast Asia’s migrant workers struggle to get by financially despite higher wages?,"JAKARTA/KUALA LUMPUR: Every night, a loud husky voice pierces through the hustle and bustle of Malaysia’s downtown Penang.

As throngs of tourists pass by her restaurant, Rosa Angelina calls out to them in Malay, English and Mandarin, inviting them to savour the establishment’s famous stir-fried noodles.

The 32-year-old Indonesian, who has been waiting tables in Malaysia for nine years, makes around RM2,000 (US$443) per month, which is around three-and-a-half times the pay waitresses make in her hometown in North Sumatra province.

Because of her language skills, her pay is also higher than that of her peers in Malaysia, who are paid the monthly minimum wage of RM1,500.



But despite this, money woes are taking a toll on Rosa’s life.

Half of her salary goes to supporting her parents, leaving her just enough to buy food, pay for public transportation and share an 18sqm room with another Indonesian woman at a property on the other side of the island, about an hour’s bus ride from where she works.

“I used to be able to rent a place somewhere close to the city centre. Nowadays, I can only afford places that are far away,” she said.

“The bus ride can be tiring, especially after a busy day like on weekends or during the holiday seasons. But it’s fine. You just have to remember that you’re doing this for your family.”

Meanwhile, in a suburb in Kuala Lumpur, a migrant worker from Myanmar who only wanted to be known as Kyaw cleans tables and sweeps the floor of a Chinese mixed-rice restaurant as customers come and go from lunch to dinner.

Despite being undocumented, the general worker is able to earn about RM2,000 a month. He gets only one off day a month.

While he gets free food at his employer’s shop, he still needs about RM1,000 a month for other expenses, including rental in a small shop lot with his fellow migrants close to where he works.

He sends RM1,000 home to his family most months although there have been times where he could only send home a few hundred ringgit because there were extra “expenses” such as bribes he had to give to the authorities due to his undocumented status.

Kyaw told CNA that he had come to Malaysia legally back in 2017 from Yangon to work but is now considered undocumented because he has overstayed his work permit. If discovered by the authorities, he could be imprisoned and deported.

Because of the political and economic situation back home, Kyaw feels he has no choice but to stay put in Malaysia for the next few years at least.

“I am doing this only for my family. They don’t really know the difficulties I am going through but I don’t have much of a choice. There isn’t any work back home,” he said, with tears in his eyes.

Across the region, millions of people from countries such as Indonesia, the Philippines and Myanmar seek employment abroad in search of a better life for themselves and their families.

Overseas, these migrant workers can earn three to five times more than doing the same job at home.

But living alone in a foreign land, away from the support of families and friends, can be daunting.

Food and rent are many times more expensive than what they cost in their respective hometowns and villages. Since many workers send the bulk of their salaries to support their families back home, what remains is barely enough to cover their own needs.

Even those without families to support can sometimes struggle to get by because they need to repay the debt they have accumulated to pay for tickets, training courses or administrative government fees before they receive their first paycheck.

Then there are those who spend their money unwisely because of low financial literacy as well as peer and family pressure, social expectations set by social media, and temptations to emulate the exorbitant lifestyles of the affluent locals they see every day.

While migrant workers’ wages have increased in the last decade in host countries across the Middle East, East Asia and Southeast Asia, these salaries sometimes fail to keep up with soaring prices.

In Hong Kong, the minimum wage went from HK$30 (US$3.86) per hour in 2013 to HK$40 an hour this year, an increase of 33.3 per cent. But property prices have also gone up by 33 per cent during the same period while food prices rose by between 2.5 and 3 per cent every year.

In the United Arab Emirates, which is a key destination for migrant workers from Southeast Asia, unskilled labourers are today paid at least 1,500 dirham (US$408) per month, a 36 per cent rise from the minimum of 1,100 dirham monthly salaries they received in 2013.

But food prices have increased by between 3 and 7 per cent annually while rent in the Gulf state has gone up by between 5 and 10 per cent annually over the last 11 years.

Meanwhile, the monthly minimum wage in Peninsular Malaysia has gone from RM900 when the country first introduced the Minimum Wage Order in 2013 to RM1,500 today. The Malaysian government has agreed to raise the minimum wage to RM1,700 a month, which will take effect in February of next year.

However, house rent has almost doubled compared to what it was a decade ago while on average, food prices have risen by around 3 per cent annually.

And migrant workers are feeling the pinch.

When Indonesian waiter Rosa first arrived in Penang nine years ago, she was paid around RM1,100 per month, slightly above the minimum wage, because of her experience working in a similar restaurant back in Indonesia.

While her salary had almost doubled since then, so too has the cost of living on the tourist island as well as back in her hometown.

“I had to spend more money on rent and I had to send more and more money home because in Indonesia, electricity bills, cooking oil, rice, everything is expensive now. So even with my raise I’m still struggling to get by,” she said.

Construction site foreman Kurnia Adi, who is from Madura, Indonesia, told CNA that salaries in the sector have generally gone down as there is less overtime work compared to before. Many migrant workers depend on overtime work to bulk up their wages.

“But many Indonesians still don’t have a choice because there is no work back home,” he said, adding that migrants earned three times the salary of what was offered in Indonesia.

Kurnia, who has been in Malaysia for about 30 years and has a professional work visa, said that the amount of earnings sent back home was becoming less as the higher cost of living affected all migrant workers.

“It’s becoming tougher and tougher. Many have to look for additional jobs outside work to supplement their incomes,” he said, adding that he was hoping to open up a business in Indonesia one day where he could provide jobs for his countrymen.

The rising costs of living can be especially hard for undocumented workers who are often powerless when employers pay them far below the minimum wage or withheld their salaries for months on end.

“I once ate nothing but instant noodles because I had no money. Some days, I didn’t eat anything at all,” said Ari Yulianto, a 40-year-old Indonesian who worked odd jobs in Malaysia from 2002 to 2020.

Ari, who had a total of seven employers over his years working in Malaysia, said one employer paid him only RM25 a day for doing construction work instead of the promised RM100 and that another owed him three months’ salary for picking oil palm fruit.

Because reporting unfair treatment to the authorities would mean exposing their status as undocumented workers, these migrant workers are also more prone to abuse and harsh working conditions compared to those with permission to work legally in the country.

Ari said he tried to hide his hardship from his wife and children back home.

He made sure he never posted pictures on social media of his dilapidated dormitory which he shared with five other workers or complained about the long and physically exhausting day at work whenever his family made a video call.

“Instead, I posted pictures of my day at the beach or my visit to the many landmarks around my city. I don’t want my children to worry about me,” the father of two said.

Ari is not alone.

Marvin Rimas of the Metro Manila-based advocacy group Migrante Philippines said families back home are often in the dark about the plights migrant workers face abroad.

“They don’t know that the migrant workers have to work long hours and are struggling to get by. All they know is that these migrant workers are sending money home which for the less fortunate can be huge,” Rimas told CNA.

There are as many as 169 million migrant workers across the globe, according to the International Labour Organization. In 2022, these workers sent home US$794 billion, the World Bank estimated.

Rimas said with the many sacrifices these migrant workers make, they expect their families to spend the remitted money wisely like opening up a business or saving up so that their children can go to college.

Instead, Rimas has seen families spending the money on lavish holidays, buying cars or other expensive items.

“When these migrant workers come back, they are shocked that there is no money left in the bank. So they had no choice but to become migrant workers again,” the Migrante Philippines secretary general said.

Some migrant workers from Indonesia also have to deal with family members wasting their hard-earned money which often leads to frictions, fights and sometimes divorce.

“We have cases where the husband received huge sums of money from their wives who are working abroad. And instead of using the money to build a better future together, the husband had another wife,” Anies Hidayah, a commissioner at the Indonesian Human Rights Commission and a long-time migrant worker’s rights advocate, told CNA.

And it is not just family members back home who fail to be mindful of how money is spent.

“There is a lot of pressure from your fellow workers. They would say: ‘Let’s go out and have drinks’ or ‘let’s go shopping’,” said Cathy, a 26-year-old Filipino who has been working as a domestic worker in Hong Kong for six years.

This was why she began buying stuff she could not afford: Smartphones, handbags, jewellery and dresses.

“I wanted to look like the tourists and expats I saw every time my friends and I went out,” Cathy, who asked CNA not to reveal her full name, said.

The pressure to appear successful on social media also served as an impetus to buy things she did not need.

The shopping addiction worsened after the COVID-19 pandemic hit, as e-commerce platforms began introducing a new feature: Buy now, pay later.

She was treating the new feature as if it was free money, sometimes spending more than what she earned in a month.

Then came the realisation that she had to pay back what she had purchased and there was no money in the bank.

“All my salary went to pay off my debts. I had to borrow money from friends and families just to feed myself,” Cathy said, adding that it took her three years to pay back all the money she had borrowed.

According to a 2019 study by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), out of 1,698 migrant workers from Southeast Asian countries surveyed, 31 per cent said they had no change in their savings upon returning from overseas while 21 per cent saw their savings decrease after their migration.

About 17 per cent of migrant workers from Southeast Asia told IOM that they came home in debt after they returned home from overseas.

Many workers incur debts by taking up huge loans even before they set foot on foreign soil.

Because of the limited number of migrant workers host countries accept each year, many are willing to pay brokers and intermediaries thousands of dollars for a chance to work abroad.

These expenses can be legitimate, like airfares, training courses and government administrative fees, but they can also be illicit in nature such as bribes.

A 40-year-old Indonesian mother of two who wished to be identified only as Nur said she had to cough up around 30 million rupiah (US$1,844) before she became a caregiver in Taiwan in May.

Around 20 million rupiah was spent on her two-month training and lodging at a migrant worker training facility in Indonesia’s Central Java province, acquiring the necessary documents needed to work in Taiwan as well as her tickets to Taipei.

The rest went to a broker who claimed he could help ensure that Nur was chosen against the hundreds of other applicants vying to work in Taiwan.

“I was told by this guy that I was actually underqualified and that my application would be rejected. But he said he knows people at the training centre. So I paid him 10 million rupiah just to guarantee a spot at the training centre,” she told CNA.

Months after her March 2024 encounter, Nur is still unsure if the man truly pulled the strings or if she was selected based on her skills and experience.

What matters is that Nur has to pay back the money she borrowed from a loan shark and a peer-to-peer lending platform, both of which charge substantially more than the 10 to 25 per cent annual interest rate of conventional banks.

With her NT$20,000 (US$615) monthly salary, some of which is spent on her day-to-day needs in Taiwan, she is struggling to pay off her debts. She has yet to send money home.

According to 2021 findings by the World Bank, 97.7 million adult Indonesians were under-banked, which means that they had little to no access to banks or similar financial institutions. This makes them vulnerable to loan sharks or other predatory lending practices.

Workers from the Philippines have also fallen into a similar debt trap with applicants taking out huge loans to pay recruitment fees and airfares.

Like their Indonesian peers, many have fallen prey to brokers and intermediaries who inflate the official costs of these fees, as well as loan sharks who sometimes charge an annual interest rate of more than 100 per cent.

The country’s under-banked population was 34.3 million, according to the 2021 World Bank study.

“I have seen many families who are in worse conditions compared to when they first became a migrant worker,” said Elisa Gumarang, a city councillor in San Isidro, a district on the outskirts of Metro Manila where many of the local population have left to work overseas.

The councillor said migrant workers sometimes found themselves abused, had their salaries withheld or got fired, long before their contracts were supposed to end. Many had to be repatriated before they could make any real money or were able to pay off their debts.

Indonesia’s newly-appointed minister for migrant workers’ protection, Abdul Kadir Karding, said on Oct 28 that he would cut down the amount of levies and expenses imposed on migrant workers arguing that these fees can be “excessive” and “exploitative”.

Meanwhile, the Philippines is mulling establishing a pension fund for overseas workers to protect workers and their families against the risks of old age, disability, sickness, death and unemployment.

But governments also need to teach their citizens financial literacy, the ability to manage income and expenditures and make informed decisions regarding money, say some organisations dedicated to migrant workers.

“They need to be able to determine how much of their salaries should go to their families, how much should go to cover their day-to-day needs abroad and how much should go into their savings account,” said Rimas of Migrante Philippines.

“Unfortunately, we don't have that kind of training programme here in the Philippines.”

Nasrikah Paidin, an adviser to the Indonesian Migrant Domestic Workers Association in Malaysia, said that financial literacy for migrant workers is of utmost importance.

She has seen how some migrants send almost everything they earn to their families, with no accountability on how they spend the hard-earned money.

“In our training, we tell the migrants that while they can give money to their family, they must also learn to say no,” she said.

“They are sacrificing for their families but it shouldn’t be like that forever. Their goal should be to at least build a house and open up a business back home once their contract is over.”

Melinda Damayanti, 29, who is from the Indonesian city of Bandung, has been working as a factory operator at a multinational company in Shah Alam, where she is in charge of assembling turntables.

Melinda, who has been working in Malaysia for eight years, feels lucky that she is provided a hostel by her employers and transportation to and from the factory every day.

She earns about RM2,800 monthly with overtime, with about RM1,000 used for her personal expenses including food. She sometimes earns bonuses and her company even provides all workers with insurance.

She hopes to be back in Indonesia in a year or two, and for the past few years has been wary of sending all her earnings back home, keeping a portion of her salary for herself in her own bank account.

“Whenever I asked my family about money, they said it had all been spent. There was nothing left for me. I felt disappointed that I personally have nothing to show for myself despite being away for a long time,” she said, adding that the decision to go to Malaysia was her own.

Melinda said that she harbours dreams of becoming a homemaker one day and would like to start a life of her own back home. That, she said, would require savings of her own.

“I can only cry sometimes to myself and wonder until when I will be here,” she said.

Knowing how to manage one’s money as well as having clear goals in mind and working hard to achieve them are key for migrant workers to be able to escape poverty, said Filipino businesswoman Rebecca Bustamante, who used to be a domestic worker in Singapore and a nanny in Canada in the 1980s and 1990s.

Like many Filipinos seeking work abroad, Bustamante, who has 10 brothers and sisters, grew up in an impoverished neighbourhood in a small coastal town about 280km northwest of Manila.

She became a domestic helper in 1986 because her family was in debt and their house was on the verge of being repossessed by the banks.

“I worked in Singapore so I can pay my family’s debt and help my siblings,” she said. “But I had a goal and that is to not become a domestic helper for the rest of my life.”

After a chance encounter with a lecturer at an open university in Singapore, she studied accounting outside her long days of being a helper.

“I was already working close to 18 hours a day but I was determined to complete my course,” Bustamante said, adding that she returned to the Philippines in 1990 with a certificate in accounting.

She then set her sights on Canada, which offered an open work permit programme. Her gateway to obtaining such a permit was to become a nanny for two years.

Armed with the accounting certificate she obtained in Singapore, she then worked as a sales representative for various companies, selling anything from kitchenware to insurance.

After years in Canada and securing permanent residency, she started her own business in 2005, helping Filipinos find white-collar work in the North American country.

“Many migrant workers think that they are destined to be nothing more than domestic helpers or blue-collar workers.

""But if you really want to give yourself a better future, you need to develop yourself, upgrade your skills and set goals,” Bustamante, who is often invited to give motivational speeches to migrant workers and aspiring entrepreneurs, said.

“I often get asked ‘what’s the secret to your success?’ But there really is no secret. It’s all about setting your mind to achieving a certain goal and putting in the time and effort to achieve it.”",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/southeast-asia-migrant-workers-financial-literacy-financial-pressures-money-woes-debt-4818131,2025-05-17T12:58:06Z
channelnewsasia,"Far From Home: Migrant workers in Malaysia seek to contribute to society, despite negative public perception of them","KUALA LUMPUR: On a hot and humid recent Sunday evening at Kuala Lumpur's Central Market, hundreds of people weave through crowded stalls selling an array of goods such as clothes, souvenirs, food and drinks.

Teeming with tour buses, the area buzzed as visitors searched for authentic Malaysian handicrafts and artworks to bring home. The back-and-forth of prices of goods echoed through the halls of the historic market - located right in the heart of Malaysia’s capital - as buyers bargained with shopkeepers.

Yet a stark contrast to the vibrant scene could be seen just on the fringe of the market's shadowed alleyways, where homeless people slept on cardboards or sat listlessly on benches watching those passing through the area.

Amid this contrast, a beacon of compassion emerges as a group of volunteers distribute warm meals, bottles of water, fruits, and soap among other things to the homeless.

One of these volunteers was Criseldo Animo, a domestic worker from the province of Mindanao in southern Philippines.

When distributing the essentials to the homeless, Animo who has worked in Malaysia for 12 years told CNA that she could only try and put herself in the shoes of those she was helping.

“I feel happy and blessed that I am able to make a slight difference,” Animo, who is in her 60s, said, adding that she plans to continue the volunteer work once she returns to the Philippines, where she noted that the poverty rate is worse as compared to Malaysia’s.

On this particular Sunday, the single mother of three had walked for several kilometres to help distribute food and drinks to those in need in downtown Kuala Lumpur in the blistering heat.

Animo is a member of FARA Philippines - a group consisting of Filipino residents and migrant workers based in Kuala Lumpur - whose main objective is to help and rescue those in distress, particularly other migrants. The organisation has chapters in different countries.

Most of its members in Malaysia - including 100 active ones - are domestic workers.

FARA Philippines is among several groups - consisting mainly of migrant workers - as well as individuals who are working quietly to help improve the lives of the local communities they are a part of.

Others, meanwhile, use social media platforms to encourage their fellow countrymen toiling away in a foreign land even as these posts offer the public a glimpse into their lives.

And despite the continued social stigma faced by some of them, many remain keen to make a positive impact in Malaysia as they eke out a living hoping for a better future when they return home.

For most domestic workers in Malaysia, Sundays are their only day off from the rigours of work. And for Jacquelou Cabello - who like Animo is also a member of FARA Philippines - doing volunteer work was a good way to spend her day off.

Cabello was a former vegetable vendor in the Philippines and came to Malaysia in 2015 in order to support her three children aged between 13 and 21.

“I feel very much empowered and blessed that I am not in the same situation as them. It gives me more motivation to help them,” said the 39-year-old from the province of Batangas, referring to the people whom the group helps.

“We understand hardship, so we want to share what little we have (with those whom we are helping).”

The group conducts outreach programmes to help the homeless about once every few months, depending on funding availability. Each member of the group contributes from their own pocket for the activities.

Virginia Babie De Vera Wong - who is the president of the FARA Philippines' chapter in Malaysia and based in Kuala Lumpur - told CNA that the group was formed in 2018 to provide emotional support to overseas Filipino workers separated from their families and to help them adapt to a new environment.

De Vera Wong, who is now a permanent resident of Malaysia, said that besides feeding the homeless, the group also makes visits to orphanages and nursing homes, providing vital aged caregiving training to those working in the latter.

FARA Philippines also collaborates with other non-governmental organisations to offer free medical screenings to migrants in Kuala Lumpur.

“It is good for the members to do this because this is one way they can meet their fellow countrymen while opening up their minds to the difficulties faced by others and being more resilient,” said De Vera Wong.

Another group from the Philippines that does outreach work monthly for the homeless is the Reformed Guardian Legion - a community group whose members include domestic workers in Kuala Lumpur.

While there is a desire to contribute back to the society, there are not many migrant workers in Malaysia who organise events for the public. Many of their contributions are more focused on supporting their own countrymen.

Some migrants told CNA that they prefer to keep to their own communities rather than engage with the locals because of the negative perceptions held against them that create an unwelcoming atmosphere.

Speaking on a condition of anonymity, one Bangladeshi activist who wanted to be known as Ibrahim expressed a desire for deeper engagement with local communities in Malaysia. But he stressed that their primary concern is the pressing needs of their own members.

""We have so many Bangladeshis struggling and needing immediate help,"" he said.

Ibrahim added that because of social stigma of foreign workers, it was almost impossible to participate in shared activities with the locals.

“Some people view us as troublemakers, so the best thing is to sometimes keep to ourselves hidden from the public view,” he said.

According to the Malaysian Department of Statistics, there were around 2.2 million documented migrant workers in Malaysia as of 2022, or about 15 per cent of the total labour force.

The reported figures exclude an estimated 1.2 to 3.5 million undocumented migrant workers, according to the World Bank.

Malaysia's foreign workforce is predominantly Bangladeshi (898,970), followed by Indonesians (582,108) and Nepalis (370,127), according to the Human Resources Minister Steven Sim.

These migrants form a substantial workforce in Malaysia, especially in the so-called “3D” – dirty, dangerous and demeaning – jobs that are usually shunned by locals.

The sectors allowed to hire foreign workers include manufacturing, plantation, agriculture, services, construction, domestic work, as well as mining and quarrying.

Ibrahim said that many from his migrant workers’ community are not educated and there is still a long way to go for them to achieve their rights, and they are therefore prone to abuses.

“Quite a number of them still don’t know their rights and it is easy to take advantage of them, especially the newer workers who don’t know their way around,” said Ibrahim, who used to study at a university in Malaysia before getting into activism to help out his fellow countrymen.

For Indonesian migrant workers in Malaysia - a group called Serantau provides a key community connection and support network.

One of Serantau’s founding members, Suherman, told CNA that the group focuses on providing information and advocacy for Indonesian migrant workers.

They conduct “train the trainer” classes, with a lot of focus currently on plantation workers.

Suherman, 39, who is from West Java and like most Indonesians go by one name, said that one big issue facing plantation workers is that of bonded labour and unpaid wages.

“There are still cases of rights abuses and we are doing our best to prevent this from happening in the first place. There is still a long way to go in many aspects related to workers’ rights,” said the father of three who works at a petrol station in Kuala Lumpur.

He said that the training sessions, held every few months, enabled participants to become advocates, extending rights awareness to their fellow workers.

The group has about 100 active members who gather support and crowdfund when Indonesian nationals find themselves in difficulty and needing urgent help. This varies from helping those who are sick, those whose wages have been withheld, or those who face repatriation.

“We work with the Indonesian embassy closely. They can’t keep track of every single Indonesian citizen and we do our best to be their eyes and ears on the ground,” he said.

Initially the group functioned as a casual weekly meeting for Indonesian nationals.

But that changed, however, when rising cases of human trafficking and people smuggling among their community spurred the group to become advocates for their rights.

Meanwhile, Suherman said that during the COVID-19 pandemic, the group distributed food aid to other migrant communities besides Indonesians that needed help because many did not have income.

“While we primarily serve the Indonesian community, during the pandemic we also helped out the Bangladeshi and Myanmar people who needed aid for humanitarian reasons,” he said.

Suherman observed a significant increase in self-organising migrant worker groups in recent years, attributing it to a heightened awareness of their rights regarding fair wages and safe working conditions.

He added that smartphones and social media have facilitated this organisation through faster communication and coordination.

“Our strength lies in numbers and for us it is important that we stick up for one another,” he said.

Meanwhile, activist Adrian Pereira of the North South Initiative - a Malaysian-based organisation that empowers migrants - said it was natural for people to form groups based on shared cultural, ethnic, and linguistic backgrounds.

He also notices that more of these groups - both formal and informal - often evolved to focus on protecting their members' rights.

“This evolution is fueled by increased rights awareness,” he said, adding that adversity and challenges - such as those faced during the COVID-19 pandemic and encouragement from trade unions - have driven the formation of more such groups.

“Some groups arise organically, while others are inspired by rights-based advocacy. As rights awareness grows, so does support and solidarity, leading to the formation of even more groups that protect their own rights.”

In Singapore, Indah Yosevina and Raman Saravanan are among many migrant workers who find joy in spending their days off amid their busy schedules to organise or participate in community programmes.

Indah, a domestic worker from Indonesia who has worked in Singapore for over six years, spends her free time organising various initiatives aimed at supporting not only the migrant community but also contributing to the wider Singapore community.

As the chairperson of the Indonesian Family Network (IFN) - an organisation made up of fellow Indonesian domestic workers - the 41-year-old has organised various exercise and educational classes to empower fellow domestic workers from Indonesia.

Beyond that, Indah - together with IFN - has also spearheaded blood donation drives and volunteer efforts to provide food for those in need in Singapore.

The network’s blood donation drive, held every three months since 2016, attracts around 40 participants of mostly Indonesian domestic workers each time, according to Indah.

“We manage it ourselves, we write a letter to the blood bank, make an appointment to pick a date and gather people,” she told CNA, adding that the initiative is open to migrant workers of other nationalities as well.

Indah has also organised volunteering initiatives for migrant workers at Singapore-based charity kitchen Willing Hearts which provides meals to the needy, including the elderly, disabled and low-income families.

The activity is held once a month on a Sunday and those interested sign up for the programme through IFN’s social media platforms.

Indah first joined IFN in 2021 to participate in its choir group and was elected as the chairperson of the network in January 2025.

Her passion for volunteering has grown since joining the network but even before that, she was also an active member of the Migrant Writers of Singapore and “The Story Behind Smile” initiative - both of which focus on shedding light on the lives of migrant workers in the country.

“For me personally, I like doing volunteering work, I like to do positive things on my off days,” she said when asked how she juggles her daily work with her community efforts.

Besides volunteering work, migrant workers in Singapore have also made a mark through the sports that they love.

On Feb 23, a team of migrant workers led by 43-year-old Raman Saravanan finished second at the annual Century Race organised by the Singapore Dragon Boat Association.

The team consisted of drivers, safety coordinators and general workers at construction sites, according to Saravanan.

“My role was to organise the team, while my friends took care of booking the coach, arranging training sessions and securing the necessary equipment.” Saravanan, who has worked in Singapore for over 20 years, told CNA.

Despite his busy schedule as a safety coordinator at a construction site, Saravanan was determined to ensure that his team - which trains once a week - would be well-prepared for the race. He even secured a sponsorship from local charity organisation ItsRainingRaincoats to support them.

“Some of my teammates had night shifts, making it difficult for them to attend training during the day and others worked on Sundays but we made the most of the time we had together,” Saravanan - who hails from India - told CNA.

Saravanan was also moved by how the journey had fostered the spirit of togetherness among his migrant friends.

“Some of my friends who work at construction sites brought food to share, along with flags and whistles to cheer us on and motivate us to paddle faster.”

For some of these migrants, they draw on their own experiences having moved abroad to a foreign land on their own to kickstart initiatives that seek to help out their respective communities.

Nasrikah Paidin founded the Indonesian Migrant Domestic Workers Association (PERTIMIG) back in 2019, drawing from her own experience where she earned a paltry RM350 (US$78.40) a month back in the late 1990s and did not have a day off.

“My Filipino colleague working in the same household was earning RM600 monthly and had a day off. I even had to work during Hari Raya,” said Nasrikah, who is from East Java.

Nasrikah, who is married to a Malaysian and now does work on a part-time basis, felt that she had to use her own experience to empower those who came after her.

“I experienced discrimination and felt that by speaking about it, I was advocating my own issues,” said Nasrikah, who still considers herself a domestic worker.

She added that while conditions have appeared to improve since then, there was still a long way to go to achieve decent work conditions for domestic workers.

“Domestic workers contribute a lot … and it is an essential sector of the economy,” said Nasrikah, who continues to advocate for a mandatory day off for all domestic workers - a right not universally granted by employers.

She has also worked towards getting protection from Malaysia’s Social Security Organisation (SOCSO) for domestic workers.

Since 2021, it has been mandatory for employers who hire local or foreign domestic workers to register and contribute for their workers to ensure social protection for their workers against work-related mishaps.

Nasrikah also conducts various classes in Kuala Lumpur on most Sundays for domestic workers, ranging from English, Mathematics, to financial literacy and workers’ rights.

“I wish I had this kind of education when I came here initially. My aim now is to help the workers achieve their migration goals and integration so they can be with their families back home instead of being a domestic worker here forever,” she said.

Meanwhile, another individual who helps her fellow countrywomen on her own volition is 45-year-old domestic worker Romlah, who goes by one name.

The Sumatra native acknowledged that she has a good boss who allows her to go out anytime and anywhere provided her work at home is completed but said that many others are facing difficulties with their employers.

Her most recent case involved an elderly Indonesian caregiver from Medan abandoned by her employer after the death of the person she was caring for.

Romlah had bumped into the woman at a bus stop in Klang and had enquired about her. She then helped the abandoned domestic worker to find a temporary shelter with the support of the Indonesian embassy.

“I have no issues on my own but when I see and hear of cases of domestic workers being abused, I feel pain inside. I feel that I have to do something,” said Romlah, who calls herself a part-time activist.

For some migrant workers, making a name in the online space provides an avenue for them to connect with their fellow countrymen. Through social media platforms such as TikTok, some Bangladeshi workers are building a strong online community, documenting their daily lives in Malaysia.

While not traditional forms of expression, these videos give an insight into their migration to Malaysia.

M.D Masud, 36, is a Bangladeshi migrant worker who has gained online fame in Malaysia for his videos on TikTok. He has more than 200,000 followers on the social media platform.

He entertains his audience with humorous songs, blending Malay lyrics with catchy Bollywood melodies. One video from November 2023 skyrocketed to 11 million views, while two others garnered seven million and three million views each, showcasing his widespread appeal.

In his videos, he urges fellow Bangladeshis to focus on work opportunities in Malaysia and saving money, rather than be blinded by romantic pursuits.

His videos are in both Malay and Bengali, with the former getting engagement from Malaysians as well.

Masud - who is from the capital city of Dhaka - told CNA that his videos are for fun and that he has had mainly positive feedback from people, including Malaysians.

Masud, who works as a supervisor in a furniture factory in Batu Pahat, Johor, said that some Malaysians even recognised him and have requested to take pictures with him.

“This is just a hobby and for fun. I can only hope that this can make Malaysians open their hearts and accept the presence of Bangladeshis and other migrant workers in the country,” Masud said in a phone interview.

Meanwhile, Jalil Ahmed uses his TikTok account to advise his fellow Bangladeshis in the Bengali language on how to conduct themselves in Malaysia. He boasts some 14,000 followers on the app.

The 30-year-old, who is now a supervisor in a construction company, has been in Malaysia since 2013. A video of him being interviewed by an online channel went viral earlier this year, with the video garnering more than 750,000 views.

The video on the MalaysianPayGap Instagram page saw Jalil speaking about his time in Malaysia and how he managed to climb up the ranks at his company, with many commending him for his hard work.

Jalil, who now earns a monthly salary of RM5,000, told CNA that he was able to command such a salary as he gained more skills and experience over the 12 years that he has been in the country. He started out earning RM900 monthly.

“I tell my fellow citizens that they also need to respect the country they are in. They have to be disciplined and can’t throw rubbish anywhere (for example),” said Jalil - who hails from Bangladesh’s Noakhali district - and was last year invited to speak at a seminar organised by the International Organisation for Migration.

He also reminds his countrymen to try and integrate with Malaysians, by purchasing from local citizens for example instead of just purchasing from shops operated by his countrymen.

“Malaysia has given me and my family back (home) a better life. My aged parents can have a relaxed life. So, we must also try to give back in some way to the local economy.”

While attitudes are changing, migrant workers in Malaysia still face significant prejudice and experience systemic discrimination despite their contributions.

A 2019 report by the International Labour Organisation found that Malaysians still have negative perceptions of migrant workers and low support for their rights.

Among other things, the survey found that almost half of respondents believed migrant workers were a drain on the economy and that 83 per cent of respondents thought that crime rates have increased due to migration.

Activist Pereira of the North South Initiative told CNA that many of these attitudes still persist to this day, with many Malaysians looking at these workers as threats that occupied and interfered in their social space.

Pereira urged that efforts be made by policymakers and politicians to ensure migrants are not viewed as hostile entities who are unfairly taking jobs and diminishing the economic opportunities available to citizens.

He added that there are certain sectors or industries where Malaysians are not interested to work in and “we have no choice but to rely on migrant labour”, whose contributions he stressed are “immense”.

“Just imagine if migrants don’t do our agriculture work, we will have a very severe food security crisis. The younger generations are not interested in continuing the legacy of farming and agriculture.

“If migrants don’t do our construction work, the cost of building will go up. There is a lot of talk about bringing data centres. Who’s going to build that? If you don’t rely on the labour of migrants, costs will escalate,” he said.

Pereira believes that more integration programmes and modules must be conducted - either by companies who bring in foreign workers or by local councils - especially in areas where they are housed.

He pointed to the example of Singapore which has various programmes and initiatives aimed at integrating migrants and locals.

“That interaction and integration together with Malaysians has to happen more often in a systematic manner. Hopefully both migrants and Malaysians will learn to appreciate each other better and respect each other’s culture,” said Pereira.

Meanwhile, Suherman of Serantau hopes that Malaysians would not generalise all migrants as those who entered the country illegally and give them due recognition for their contributions.

“Look at the nice condominiums and roads you have. It is from the blood and sweat of migrants,” he said.

Agreeing, Jalil - the Bangladeshi activist - said that he hopes that Malaysians would look at migrants with respect and as those who have done their part for the development of the country.

“Please don’t look at us as animals but as humans,” he said.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/migrant-workers-malaysia-contribute-society-settling-5009731,2025-05-17T12:58:06Z
channelnewsasia,"Far From Home: Back for good after years abroad as migrant workers, they struggle with new realities in own countries","JAKARTA: Ayu Rosita thought she was coming home to a place she knew but when she finally set foot in Indonesia in 2024 after 15 years of working overseas, nothing was the way she remembered them. It was her first time back in her home country after all those years away.

New houses, auto repair shops and convenience stores had sprung up around her village in the mountainous region of West Java, some two hour drive south of Jakarta. The once quiet roads were buzzing with a constant stream of lorries, cars and motorcycles.

In the distance, atop hills and mountain slopes, hotels and restaurants were being built, luring tourists from nearby Jakarta looking for a quick weekend getaway.

But despite the development and the subsequent population growth around her, Ayu felt isolated and lonely.



Most of her friends had moved to other cities while some of her relatives had passed away. The only people left in her village were mostly nephews and nieces whom she barely knew because they were children when she last saw them.

“I felt like a stranger in my own village. I was restless because I was used to working hard everyday and now I stay home all day with little to do,” said 41-year-old Ayu, who previously worked as a domestic helper in Saudi Arabia before deciding to return home to care for her aged and sickly mother.

To keep her mind busy, Ayu tried looking for a job but owners of nearby restaurants and shops prefer someone younger. With her experience, she could try becoming a domestic helper again in Indonesia, but it would mean having to live with a family in cities like Jakarta where demands for such services are stronger.

She would also have to be away from her mother.

Ayu’s struggles are not uncommon among returning migrant workers around the globe. Many returnees - particularly those who have spent an extended period of time abroad - find it hard to reintegrate into their community of origin, sometimes leading to issues such as depression and anxiety.

Over the last five years, several organisations and migrant worker collectives have established support groups to make sure the stress and hassle of reintegrating back to their original communities are well mitigated.

Meanwhile, returnees also have had to deal with limited job opportunities in their respective countries - the very reason why many become migrant workers in the first place.

Governments in migrant worker sending countries like Indonesia and the Philippines have promised to address these issues by offering cash assistance, soft loans as well as entrepreneurship programmes and upskilling courses among others.

While there have been success stories, experts noted that they are the exceptions rather than the norm, adding that more work needs to be done to make sure these returning migrant workers do not fall back into poverty.

Faye Miranda left her three boys behind in Rodriguez, a municipality just outside of Metro Manila, in 2021 because her construction worker husband could not find work at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.

She went to Kuwait to become a domestic worker but just four months before her two-year contract ended, her middle child suddenly became gravely ill and had to be rushed to the hospital.

“When I landed here on Mar 9, 2023, I went to the hospital straight from the airport. That’s when I saw that my son was already in a coma,” Miranda told CNA.

“It was so painful to me. Because I went abroad for my children, to give them a good life, to provide them an education.”

Miranda’s son, Jerome, was diagnosed with brain haemorrhage. He died at the age of 14 just four days after Miranda returned to the Philippines.

Riddled with guilt for not being able to be there for her son, the 41-year-old soon fell into depression with much of her days spent in bed sobbing.

One day, a friend reached out to Miranda, offering her to come to a sharing session organised by a group of former migrant workers.

“Sharing my story with people who understand or have similar experiences helped me cope with the pain I feel inside,” Miranda said, adding that ever since she has been attending similar sessions and workshops organised by the group: Sandigan.

The group was founded in 2020, at the height of the pandemic, when the Philippines saw an influx of returning migrant workers because they either lost their jobs or feared that they would not be able to return home as host countries began closing their borders.

Similarly, support groups in Indonesia also began cropping up during the pandemic, particularly in areas with a large migrant worker population.

“Some of these groups started as informal gatherings of friends and neighbours. Most disbanded after one or two sessions but there are those which are still active today,” said Wahyu Susilo, executive director of Indonesian-based non-profit organisation, Migrant Care.

In Dadap - a village in the coastal region of West Java where nearly 80 per cent of its households have at least one member of the family who have worked overseas – such group began as an impromptu snack-making workshop back in 2020.

""A lot of people, be it returning migrant workers or those who stay in Indonesia, fell on hard times during the pandemic because there were no jobs both abroad or at home,” said Elly Kusumah, the coordinator of the village’s Migrant Workers’ Empowerment Group.

“We have a lot of cassavas in our village, so why not try to turn them into chips? We have a lot of fruits, so why not turn them into jams?”

As more former migrants participated in the programme, they began interacting more closely with each other. Elly noted that many were facing difficulties readjusting to life in Indonesia. Although Elly was never a migrant worker herself, she sympathised with their plights.

“Some felt they were ridiculed by family members because they now speak with a Malaysian accent and sounded like Upin Ipin,” she said, referring to a Malaysian cartoon programme popular in both Malaysia and Indonesia.

“Others shared about struggling to reconnect with their children after being away for so long. The problems varied.”

Disharmony between migrating parents and their children left behind is just one of the many impacts of migration.

Without the structure of a nuclear family and the love and attention provided by both parents, children sometimes misbehave, perform poorly at school or get into trouble.

Meanwhile, marriages are also put to the test, as infidelity runs rampant both abroad and at home.

Lack of support and acceptance can be a challenge for returning migrant workers looking to reintegrate back to their communities.

""During the migration process, people learn and adopt new skills, experiences and norms that shape and enrich their lives,” the International Organization of Migration (IOM) wrote in a study published last August.

“All these factors make it difficult for returning migrants to fit into their community of origin, as there is a rupture between who they are now and who they are expected to be by people who knew them prior to migrating.”

One way to gain acceptance and support is to prove that these returnees can once again become a productive member of their respective communities.

With the money he saved while working in Malaysia from 2002 to 2020, Ari Yulianto was able to start a business in his village in the mountainous region of East Java.

“One of my friends inherited a mushroom farm but he wasn’t interested in continuing his family business. So he sold the farm to me,” said the 40-year-old Indonesian.

For the first few harvest cycles, his crop failed as mould infested his mushroom farm. But he refused to give up, adjusting his farming techniques until he got things right.

“Today, I’m making enough money to feed my family and employ two full-time workers,” Ari said, adding that his farm is able to produce one tonne of mushroom every month, earning him a profit of 15 million rupiah (US$913) monthly.

That amount is roughly twice what he made during his migrant worker days back in neighbouring Malaysia.

But not all migrant workers can save enough money to start their own businesses once they return home. Because of low financial literacy as well as peer and family pressure, many spend their pay unwisely making them unable to save anything or even fall into debt.

According to a 2019 study by the IOM, 31 per cent of the migrant workers from Southeast Asian countries surveyed said they had no change in their savings upon returning from overseas while 21 per cent saw their savings decrease after their migration.

About 17 per cent of migrant workers from Southeast Asia told IOM that they have accumulated debt upon returning home from overseas.

Indonesian Minister for Migrant Workers’ Affairs Abdul Kadir Karding has promised more upskilling courses and soft loans to encourage former migrant workers to start their own businesses.

“We are working with the Ministry of Small and Medium Enterprises to provide a low-interest business loan of up to 100 million rupiah,” Abdul said in a statement on Mar 6.

“We are also working with several educational institutions and communities to provide upskilling programmes which can help former migrant workers to be more economically independent.”

The initiative is still in its pilot stage and it is not known how many will benefit from it.

Meanwhile, the Philippine’s Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) also has a similar programme. Since 2017, it has been providing grants of up to 20,000 pesos (US$350) for returning migrant workers as well as various entrepreneurship training for them.

But the number of beneficiaries for these programmes is limited. In 2023, only 3,348 returnees benefited from OWWA’s cash assistance initiative while 12,248 participated in its capacity building training and seminars. The Philippines welcomed around 800,000 returning migrant workers each year.

“The programme does little to alleviate poverty among returning migrant workers because it only provides a small amount of money to so few people,” said Marvin Rimas, the secretary-general of advocacy group Migrante Philippines.

And despite the well-meaning initiative, not everyone is fit to be an entrepreneur.

Former migrant worker Ayu, for example, once dipped her toes in catfish cultivation, building two rectangular concrete ponds in her backyard as well as buying pumps, filters and other equipment before deciding several months later that it is not for her.

“(Catfish) are actually quite easy to cultivate but there is a lot of competition and demand is not so strong. So I ended up just giving the fishes away to neighbours,” Ayu said, adding that she also tried switching to other types of fish like tilapia and goldfish with similar disappointing results.

Ayu said she lost about 15 million rupiah in the fish venture, around a third of the money she saved from working overseas. She then tried her hands at opening a small shop selling drinks and snacks in front of her house.

“The profit margin is pretty slim and barely enough to cover expenses like keeping the refrigerator running,” Ayu said.

The venture is still running but with plenty of competition from similar shops in her village, she is unsure for how long.

What Ayu said she needs is a steady job, but with Indonesia seeing a decline in the number of middle class which affects household spending such as hiring a domestic helper, the future looks bleak.

Meanwhile, Angelo Jimenez - the president of the University of the Philippines and a long-time labour rights advocate - said migrant worker sending countries need to address rampant unemployment at home.

Indonesia and the Philippines have some of the highest unemployment rates in Southeast Asia, standing at 4.8 and 4.3 per cent respectively at the end of 2024. In contrast, Thailand had an unemployment rate of 1.02 per cent while Singapore had 1.9 per cent during the same period.

Overseas Filipinos sent home US$40 billion last year, according to the World Bank, contributing to 9.2 per cent of the Philippine’s gross domestic product (GDP). Meanwhile, Indonesians abroad sent home US$11 billion last year, representing 0.8 per cent of the country’s GDP.

“Remittances from migrant workers have contributed so much to these countries’ economies that some governments spend more time promoting and encouraging people to work overseas than developing their own industries,” Jimenez said.

“The most important thing for a country is to provide jobs so that migration becomes only a choice and not a necessity.”

In the Philippines, Miranda is also looking for a job, which she believes will not only supplement her family’s income but also keep her mind away from the grief of losing a child.

But with limited job opportunities available in her hometown, Rodriguez, finding work has not been easy.

“People (in the Philippines) are afraid of hiring a former migrant worker because they think we expect a big salary. That is not the case,” she said. “They also want someone who is young and has degrees, diplomas and certificates. I don’t have those things.”

To supplement the family’s income, Miranda has been selling snacks, earning just a few dollars every morning. In the afternoon, she goes downtown to look for work.

“It’s tiring and rejection after rejection makes me feel like a failure,” Miranda said, adding that it sometimes made her fall deeper into a state of depression. “For now, I will keep trying. But if my luck doesn’t change, I might as well become a migrant worker again.”",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/migrant-workers-returning-home-reintegration-5026846,2025-05-17T12:58:06Z
channelnewsasia,IN FOCUS: Burn or bury? Malaysia eyes new incinerators to tackle mounting waste woes but faces residents’ ire,"KUALA LUMPUR: In his hometown of Batu Arang in Selangor, 65-year-old Ravi Shankar is rallying against the authorities.

Ravi and fellow residents are fighting the proposed construction of an incinerator, or the Sultan Idris Shah waste-to-energy plant (WTE) - named after the Selangor ruler - in their backyard.

Residents from the nearby areas of Tasik Puteri, Kota Puteri, and Rawang are also mobilising against the authorities, their shared concern stemming from the planned facility's location.

The proposed plant is located next to a former mining pool that has now been sealed off to the public.



“There are still underground tunnels here and we are afraid that if water is needed to cool the incinerator, it might be pumped out again and cause ground instabilities,” said Ravi.

“Our main concern is the location. It is very close to residential areas,” he added.

The protracted dispute in Batu Arang serves as a stark illustration of Malaysia's broader crisis in handling its increasing volumes of solid waste.

This issue is becoming increasingly urgent as the nation's landfills - what the country currently relies on to manage the issue - are expected to be filled to capacity by 2050.

While experts say the WTE incinerators are a necessity to manage the country’s waste management woes, environmentalists and non-governmental groups are expressing concerns over potential health issues and some WTEs’ proximity to residential areas.

For Ravi, his actions are fuelled, not just by concern for the future, but also memories of the past.

Over three decades ago, the town of Batu Arang in Selangor was plagued by land subsidence and sinkholes. Back then, Ravi was among those who protested against a cement company they alleged was the cause of those incidents.

The cement company Associated Pan Malaysia Company had been pumping water from former mining pools for its operations and this was the supposed cause of the collapse of the tunnels located under the town.

The then-Selangor government even told residents that it was unsafe and that they might have to move out.

A series of protests caused the company to stop the pumping of water, and since then, there have been no reported incidents of subsidence in Batu Arang, which was declared a heritage town by the Selangor State Government in 2011 and recognised as part of the Gombak-Hulu Langat Geopark.

“What’s happening today brings back memories of the past,” Ravi, a former supervisor at an ammunition manufacturer, told CNA recently, while holding a scrapbook of old newspaper clippings about the incidents that made headlines in 1991.

He and fellow residents are concerned that the RM4.5 billion (US$1 billion) joint venture between YTL Power and waste management company KDEB could lead to a repeat of past issues.

Driven by evolving consumption patterns, population growth, rapid urbanisation, improved economic standing, and changing consumer habits, Malaysia faces an escalating burden of increasing waste output.

According to Housing and Local Government Minister Nga Kor Ming, last year's waste generation reached an estimated 15.2 million tonnes, a 20 per cent increase from 12.63 million tonnes in 2012.

Projecting a continued annual increase of 0.9 per cent to 1.2 per cent, Nga said in a parliamentary reply last December that Malaysia could see over 17 million tonnes of waste generated annually by 2035.

While environmentalists and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have spoken about their concerns on incinerators, waste management experts have said that WTE facilities are not merely optional but essential for the long term.

“The question is not whether we need it. The question is where do we locate it?” Agamuthu Pariatamby, a waste management expert at the Jeffrey Sachs Center on Sustainable Development in Malaysia, told CNA.

The proposed WTE plant in Batu Arang will be responsible for waste from six municipalities in Selangor, namely Petaling Jaya, Subang Jaya, Shah Alam, Ampang Jaya, Hulu Selangor and Selayang.

In 2022, KDEB reported collecting an average of 6,012 tonnes of waste per day from the whole state of Selangor, with these six municipalities contributing 3,526 tonnes or almost 60 per cent of that total amount.

The plant is said to be capable of processing 2,400 tonnes of waste per day while generating 58 MW of electricity, equivalent to the electricity consumption of 50,000 households, according to an environmental impact assessment by the Department of Energy.

Currently, Malaysia primarily relies heavily on landfills - both sanitary and unsanitary - for waste disposal.

According to Agamuthu, there are 142 landfills in Malaysia, of which only 21 are sanitary while five are inert sites for construction and demolition debris.

A sanitary landfill is an engineered waste disposal site that isolates waste from the environment using liners, covers, and leachate collection systems, among other things, to minimise pollution and health risks but these measures cost more than unsanitary landfills.

The Bukit Tagar sanitary landfill is an often-cited example of a progressive approach to waste management in Malaysia, as it captures the methane gas produced by decomposing waste and converts it into electricity for the national grid.

Koh Chee Yong, the managing director of Berjaya Enviroparks Sdn BHd, which operates the facility, told CNA that the landfill receives about 2,721 tonnes of waste per day from Kuala Lumpur, as well as the districts of Selayang and Hulu Selangor in Selangor.

Agamuthu is, however, more concerned with the remaining non-sanitary 116 landfills that are active and the other illegal dumpsites around the country. These sites lack adequate environmental safeguards, he said.

He highlighted leachate, the contaminated liquid generated by water filtering through landfill waste, as one of the primary challenges of continuing to dump waste in unsanitary landfills.

He said that uncontained leachate from landfills contaminates groundwater, surface water - harming aquatic life and ecosystems - as well as soil, affecting plant growth.

“The landfills are doing damage, it’s just that people don't see it. Landfills are away from the city … You don't see the leachate. It is flowing underneath,” he said.

“And you can't see the biogas, because it's colourless. But that doesn't mean there's no damage.”

The Department of National Solid Waste Management did not respond to CNA’s enquiries on the subject.

Agamuthu also pointed out that landfills generally take up space and because of land costs, they are mostly located away from urban areas.

“Where is the waste being generated? It’s mainly in the big cities. And big cities have no land.

“That's why they had to find a place about 40km or 45km away to throw the waste in the landfill there,” he said.

“So this becomes an issue. The cost of land is very high within the city. And … the moment you put the landfill far away, the transport cost goes up.”

Nga - the minister - had told Malaysia’s parliament in July of last year that the ministry planned to modernise the country’s solid waste management by setting up 18 WTE plants by 2040. He did not give a projected cost.

The sites are:

Malaysia currently has five small-scale incinerators that are located in Pulau Langkawi, Pulau Tioman, Cameron Highlands, Pulau Labuan and Pulau Pangkor but these are not WTE plants.

The biggest of these, which is located in Pulau Langkawi, has been plagued with issues over the years and is currently not in operation.

WTEs generate energy from non-recyclable waste by using a controlled incineration method. A crane blends the waste and transfers it to the combustion chamber.

The waste is burned at a high temperature - between 850°C and 1,450°C - and the resulting heat converts water into steam.

In the past, Malaysia has had to shelve proposed plans to build WTE plants in the town of Broga in Selangor in 2007 and in the locality of Jinjang in Kuala Lumpur in 2021 following protests by local residents.

Critics of WTE plants, such as environmental group Greenpeace, have claimed that living near an incinerator poses numerous health hazards, and even the most high-tech WTE incinerators release dioxins and other pollutants into the air.

However, Agamuthu said that the incineration systems have evolved and that the gas cleaning system, or the flue gas cleaning system, is much more advanced compared to 10 years ago.

“So we have systematically removed everything from the flue gas such as the solid particles, biogas, dioxin and fuel. So the gas that's eventually coming out is much cleaner than I would say, the air in Kuala Lumpur,” he said.

“We have been saying no to WTE plants for too long,” he added.

Waste management expert Theng Lee Chong echoed these views and said that there was no running away from WTE plants, saying that in countries such as Japan, incinerators are located within communities.

He has seen how the facilities are located next to a kindergarten and a senior residents’ home, even generating heat for the seniors’ bath.

According to Japan’s Ministry of Environment, there were 1,004 incinerators in the country as of March 2024, with 411 of them able to generate power.

Theng said that while a landfill buries waste, it doesn't eliminate problems entirely.

“It’s underneath and you don’t see it but it will remain there for thousands of years. With an incinerator, there will be ash as a by-product but the volume is reduced by 90 per cent, depending on the technology,” he said, pointing to the likes of Singapore which has four WTE plants, the first of which began operating back in 1979.

Singapore's plants are all in industrial areas, with three located in Tuas and one in Senoko.

The ash and non-incinerable waste like sludge are then placed in the Semakau landfill, which is located about 8km south of Singapore and expected to reach capacity by 2035.

The Singapore government has said that there are ongoing efforts to extend the lifespan of the landfill beyond 2035, as well as research and development into repurposing waste residues such as incineration ash.

For instance, it is studying whether landfilled incineration ash and non-incinerable waste from Semakau landfill can be used as reclamation in the Tuas port project.

Meanwhile, the country has started to repurpose some incinerated ash into NewSand for the construction of non-structural concrete applications such as footpaths and benches.

WTE plants are gaining more traction in the region, with Indonesia announcing in March that it is set to develop 30 WTE plants in major cities across the country by 2029.

Thailand is also planning on adding more WTE plants in the country, with at least 25 operating in the country as of 2022.

There have been protests against the plants in these countries in the past, but the governments have had to push ahead with their WTE plans given that they face similar challenges on mounting waste as Malaysia.

According to Theng, if Malaysia’s landfills were reclaimed for future development, remediation costs would be necessary.

Remediating a former landfill involves restoring the site to a usable condition after it has been filled with waste and closed.

“You don’t factor in the opportunity costs that you cannot use or develop the land for, say for 100 years,” he said, referring to the lost potential and value of that land being unavailable for other development for a very long duration.

He also pointed out the significant suffering of communities near landfills, who often endure foul odours, increased vermin and pest populations, decreased property values, and the general degradation of their living environment.

Just weeks ago, it was reported that residents of Kampung Desa Makmur in Kota Tinggi, Johor, have been protesting the Batu Empat landfill, which they say has been causing severe odour pollution for almost 20 years.

In response, Johor’s Housing and Local Government Committee Mohd Jafni Md Shukor was reported to have urged the federal government to expedite the construction of a WTE plant at the Bukit Payong Sanitary Solid Waste Landfill near Batu Pahat.

Theng said that there was no single formula for waste management and one technology cannot apply to the whole country and that in order to operate a WTE sustainably, it must receive at least 500 tonnes of waste daily.

However, he hoped the government would explain the long-term financing model for the WTE plants, specifically whether it would involve a public-private partnership, especially as there were substantial costs in building them.

“How will the government close the financial gap? Will the consumers have to pay more for the waste management? This part has yet to be explained,” he said.

Seeram Ramakrishna, a professor at the National University of Singapore’s Department of Mechanical Engineering, told CNA that WTE plants are a “stepping stone” to deal with the whole issue of waste.

He said that compared to conventional landfills, WTE plants create value from waste by generating energy and that Singapore's well-developed WTE infrastructure was initially a necessity due to its limited land availability.

He added that while WTEs offer a degree of progress through energy generation, it is crucial to ensure stringent emission controls.

“WTE facilities must guarantee that their emissions pose no threat to human health and that the released air is of high quality – this is a fundamental expectation,” he said.

The central question, Agamuthu posed, was the crucial issue of WTE plant location, given the common ""not in my backyard"" sentiment among residents anywhere in the world.

Jaringan Rawang Tolak Insinerator is an NGO that has been actively protesting and voicing its concerns against the planned incinerator in Batu Arang, submitting objections to local authorities.

Its spokesperson Abdul Hanan Abd Mokti told CNA that the proposed incinerator site is very close to vulnerable communities.

“The selection of Batu Arang continues the worldwide trend of locating incinerators in marginalised and less-affluent communities,” he said, adding that an estimated 100,000 residents reside within a 5km radius of the proposed site's centre.

He also asked the basis of selecting Batu Arang and Rawang - located about 17km apart - for the sites of two proposed WTE incinerators, fearing that the area will be overwhelmed by garbage trucks travelling to the incinerator via local roads.

“Why are so many of these high-risk, highly toxic projects being concentrated in the same district?,” he said, adding that there are worries that property values in the area may plummet because of the projects.

According to the Department of Energy environmental impact assessment report which was released on May 7, 91.3 per cent of respondents surveyed in 2025 either opposed or strongly opposed the Sultan Idris Shah project, compared to just 18.8 per cent of respondents in a 2023 survey.

The report attributed the significant decline in support for the project to the increased public awareness of it.

A WTE plant is already being built at the Jeram sanitary landfill in Kuala Selangor. However, unlike other WTEs, not much opposition has been registered towards it.

It is located about 5km away from the nearest residential areas and is surrounded by palm oil plantations. It is expected to start operating next year, according to media reports.

The project is a joint venture between Worldwide Holdings Berhad, a Selangor state-owned company and Shanghai Electric Power Generation (M) Sdn Bhd (Shanghai Electric). The plant is designed to process up to 3,000 tonnes of solid waste daily.

Aziah Parini, a resident of Kampung Bukit Kerayong 1 - located about 5km away from the plant -  told CNA that several NGOs had come to the village to speak about the dangers of the incinerator.

However, the 49-year-old, who operates a food stall, said that they were not worried about the plant.

“We can only hope for the best and that it will not affect the people around here,” said the grandmother of one.

Despite differing opinions on specific waste management solutions, there is a fundamental agreement among all waste management experts and NGOs: The sheer volume of waste Malaysians generate must be significantly reduced at its source.

According to deputy housing and local minister Aiman Athirah Sabu, the national recycling rate increased to 37.9 per cent in 2024 from 35.4 per cent in 2023, but still hasn't reached the 40 per cent target for 2025.

The average waste generation per capita in 2022 was estimated at about 1.05kg per day, significantly higher than that of other Asian countries which range from 0.4 to 0.7 kg per day, said Agamuthu.

Agamuthu believes that the amount of waste is increasing because of the sophistication of people’s standard of living.

“The more affluent we are, the more waste is generated,” he said.

He added that while the rising standard of living generally meant more waste, the amount per capita in Japan has reduced over the years because of focused policies and public awareness.

“They are already educated enough to reduce the waste themselves,” he said, adding that the layperson should be educated on their responsibility of waste separation at source.

Seeram said that effective waste management necessitates a primary focus on source segregation, as this practice unlocks the potential for “waste mining” and the creation of valuable resources.

""Ideally, WTE initiatives, while a treatment method, should align with the principles of a circular economy, viewing waste as a resource.

""This requires the development and implementation of robust processes for waste segregation and cleaning to facilitate resource recovery, which represents the most desirable long-term scenario,"" he said.

He added that WTE should not be perceived merely as a temporary step towards better waste management and that instead, the fundamental focus must remain on controlling and reducing waste at its source.

""Japan for example excels in waste management compared to many other nations, largely due to its ingrained cultural values,"" he said.

Tasha Sabapathy, a senior programme and communications officer of Zero Waste Malaysia - an NGO that promotes a zero waste lifestyle - told CNA that the government should prioritise solutions based on the context that food waste is the majority of waste.

The composition of household waste in Malaysia in 2022 was dominated by food waste (30.6 per cent), with plastic (21.9 per cent) and paper (15.3 per cent) making up the next largest segments.

Sabapathy said she wants to see an increase in composting facilities as well as community composting initiatives. She also advocates the banning of single-use plastics, noting how some restaurants these days even use plastic packets instead of cups to serve drinks.

She said that the public should ultimately understand what happened to their waste.

“What happens after we drink a coffee (purchased) from a store. Where does the cup go? If it gets recycled, they won’t care. But the truth is it cannot be recycled because of the way it is made. It is the same for any kind of waste.

“We need to know what happens to it and who are the communities affected and bring that education to everyday people. Then we will understand why we need to be responsible for it,” she said, adding that incineration discourages recycling.

One of Bukit Arang’s resident Yap Wan Ken, 53, acknowledges that while people could register their protest against the incinerator, everyone has a role to also reduce their own waste.

She recycles as much as possible and composts her wet household waste. She has used the compost to grow her own flowers, vegetables, and fruit, such as pineapples.

Yap, who works in finance, said that global warming is not a joke and hopes that what she does contributes to the betterment of the environment.

“We are the ones who also contribute to the waste, it doesn’t generate on its own. I always believe solutions to an issue are always at the source, not at the end, in order for long-term success.

“I hope our government and fellow Malaysians can work together to reduce waste at the source for the sake of the environment and minimise the need for incinerators,” she said.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/malaysia-faces-questions-over-waste-energy-incinerators-5124421,2025-05-17T12:58:06Z
channelnewsasia,"Better coverage, but exploited for crime? Southeast Asia confronts Starlink internet dilemma","BANGKOK: It was Feb 20 when the first flights carrying Chinese nationals extracted from scamming compounds in the Myanmar border city of Myawaddy took to the sky.  
 
Joint Thai-Chinese operations had been launched to disrupt criminal enterprises reportedly holding hundreds of thousands of people and generating billions of dollars.  
 
They seemed effective; thousands of compound workers were released from captivity and streamed across the Thai border, close to the city of Mae Sot. 
 
In the aftermath of the raids, Erin West found herself on the border observing what was unfolding. It was not the first time the self-proclaimed “scam fighter” had been there.  
 
But she was seeing for the first time what she had heard through message groups that included individuals identified as being inside the compounds across the river: That satellite internet provider Starlink was being used, its terminals smuggled into the borderlands by criminal actors.  
 
In their hands, fast, reliable and unauthorised internet was now powering a spate of illicit activities. 
 
Starlink, operated by American billionaire Elon Musk’s space technology company SpaceX, works using a series of low-Earth orbit satellites to deliver signals, while cellular networks use on-ground infrastructure across different bandwidths to deliver internet coverage. 
 
While its services are not authorised for use in Myanmar and illicit activities are not allowed under Starlink policies, criminal groups are able to use their illegal devices to access spillover internet bandwidth that Starlink provides to legitimate users in the broader region.

The Myanmar Internet Project estimated last year that more than 3,000 Starlink devices were active in the country and were the “the only viable solution for instant internet”, one of its analysts told Voice of America (VOA), given the multiple internet shutdowns by authorities there.  
 
The Myanmar Internet Project is a collective of researchers and practitioners tracking digital developments in Myanmar.  
 
The satellite internet is also being used by other groups like humanitarian organisations and rebel groups in conflict with the junta, it found. 
 
During their operation, Thai authorities had attempted to throttle the criminal groups’ activity by switching off electricity and telecom access. What West realised was that it no longer really mattered.  
 
She was originally tipped off to Starlink’s presence in the area through messages last year from someone identified as being inside a scamming compound.

“This person, over and over, kept saying, ‘just get them to turn off the Starlink. If they turned off the Starlink, that would stop this whole problem’,” she said. 
 
The messages prompted her to write to the General Counsel of SpaceX last July in alarm. 
 
West is a former deputy district attorney in California and the founder of Operation Shamrock, a movement dedicated to disrupting the global “pig butchering” epidemic. Pig butchering refers to love-and-investment scams in which the scammers groom their victims over a period of time. 
 
West said she did not receive a reply from SpaceX: “I was hopeful. I was disappointed.” 
 
She was not the only one to reach out to Musk’s operation. Rangsiman Rome, a Thai opposition parliamentarian and chair of committee on national security and border issues also expressed concerns about the use of Starlink by criminal groups. 
 
“We’ve been exposing scam centres in Southeast Asia and uncovered solid proof that cybercriminals in this region are exploiting Starlink for massive fraud,” he wrote on X, tagging Musk, in February. 
 
“This is a serious issue with real-world consequences. We have been pushing for immediate actions from our government to cut electricity and internet to the compounds, but they have begun to utilise Starlink to access the internet instead. Could you look into this matter?”

On the same day the repatriation flights were taking place from Northern Thailand, about 1,000 kilometres away, Musk’s company representatives were making a pitch to formally expand their operations elsewhere in the region. 
 
Cambodia’s prime minister Hun Manet, alongside other national agencies, was meeting with Rebecca Hunter, the marketing director of SpaceX and Starlink, to discuss the expansion of satellite internet in the kingdom. 
 
In Cambodia, more than 150,000 people were estimated by aid organisation USAID to be ensnared by the scamming industry. Industry observers say scamming compounds operate in plain sight and are also reliant on stable internet connections. 
 
With purported compounds popping up in many remote parts of the country, West observed, the risk is high in her opinion that Starlink would also be used for nefarious purposes, just as it is in Myanmar. 
 
“My concern is that existing infrastructure for cell service will likely be inadequate to support the need in these remote locations and Starlink will fit beautifully into (scammers’) ability to transact this bad business,” she said. 
 
While Starlink could deliver better internet for many communities, especially in remote areas underserved by existing network infrastructure, it could also create dependency on a foreign entity to provide an essential service, and if left unregulated, heighten the ability for criminals to have unfettered access to internet networks, experts said.  
 
While governments currently can regulate and control traditional internet through infrastructure, content moderation and legal frameworks, Starlink’s services present a different challenge. 
 
Territorial jurisdictional control of satellites remains an area of contention and laws governing their use are underdeveloped.



The last major space treaty was signed in 1979, meaning SpaceX, a private actor, is operating in grey areas that governments may not have faced before when it comes to oversight.  
 
Musk’s control of the network raises concerns about whether access could be revoked, restricted, or manipulated based on shifting political or economic interests, Surachanee Sriyai, a Visiting Fellow with the Media, Technology and Society Programme at ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute, wrote in a commentary for CNA. 
 
If Cambodia was to grant a licence to allow Starlink to operate in its skies, it would become the fourth Southeast Asian nation to do so after the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia. 
 
And SpaceX has plans to further expand in the region. 
 
In March, Vietnam approved a five-year pilot implementation of SpaceX’s low orbit satellite technology, which could lead to a major future investment by Musk’s company.  
 
Thailand has not licensed Starlink but its National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission approved in January a six-month collaboration between SpaceX and Prince of Songkla University focused on disaster relief, telemedicine and learning applications. 
 
Further afield in India, two major telecom operators - Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd - have signed separate deals with SpaceX, but it is not yet legally allowed to operate.

While the Myanmar situation is particularly fraught given the ongoing civil war, more broadly throughout the region, governments are facing a choice: Whether to allow Starlink to set up operations. 
 
The Philippines was the early mover in Southeast Asia.  
 
Its National Telecommunications Commission granted Starlink the necessary licences in May 2022 and said the main reason was to provide cost-effective internet in villages underserved by telecommunication providers.  
 
“The telcos were not incentivised to also serve the lightly populated areas. So, the rural areas have been left behind in terms of internet,” explained Wilson Chua, chief executive of Future Gen International, a data, analytics and business process outsourcing firm. 
 
“Starlink is a game changer. You can set up anywhere, even at sea. When Starlink started to pop up, we saw growth like mushrooms.” 
 
Chua set up Project Bass, a citizen advocacy group where volunteers use an app to record internet speed and coverage wherever they are. It has given an insight into the spread of Starlink in the past few years.  
 
The project most recently detected close to 1,500 active Starlink devices across the Philippines, but Chua believes this is an underestimate. 
 
He said he has been surprised by the number of users in the Metro Manila area, where internet service should be reliable. Users may be preparing for contingencies, he said. 
 
“Either the building that they have does not provide them with sufficient bandwidth or these are people that are preparing for a disaster,” he said, adding that a major earthquake could disrupt the country’s internet.  
 
“As well, if you look at the undersea cables providing internet to the Philippines, you can count them in the palm of your hand. And Starlink is a way for us to be sort of prepared.” 
 
Entrepreneurs are also finding cost efficiencies by setting up Starlink devices and distributing the bandwidth to multiple users or entire communities, he said.  
 
The Philippine government has been monitoring the grey area that exists around such enterprises and a new Bill should soon make such competition legal. The country’s senate passed the Konektadong Pinoy Act in February allowing smaller players to more easily enter the market and promote infrastructure sharing among providers. 
 
“The government now recognises that (established telecom companies) did not deliver on infrastructure and so when COVID-19 came, education wasn't functioning, medical services weren’t functioning,” Chua said.

Indonesia faces similar issues. 
 
About a-fifth of the population in the vast archipelago lacks adequate internet access, according to the Indonesian Internet Service Providers Association.  
 
But while the Indonesian government welcomed Starlink to the country and granted business licences in May last year, analysts say it remains wary about allowing the company to fill the gaps. 
 
It is currently unclear how many Starlink devices are operational in Indonesia and the company’s initial investment was modest at US$1.8 million. 
 
Still, with Musk in attendance, Starlink launched with fanfare in Bali with a project to connect medical centres to fast internet service. In at least one centre though, the service was disabled shortly after due to an apparent unstable connection. 
 
There is pressure from traditional telecom companies on the government to ensure the playing field is even after decades of investing in an infrastructure network that could be made redundant by Musk’s satellites, said Karl Gading Sayudha, an analyst who focuses on defence, security and international relations at Kiroyan Partners, a Jakarta-based consulting firm. 
 
“These telecommunication providers have invested billions of rupiah. So they are questioning the government's effort and government's responsibility to make sure that this will be a fair game,” he said.

“They are asking for the government to regulate this before it goes too far.” 
 
The Indonesian Internet Service Provider Association urged the government in the middle of last year to freeze Starlink's licence, because it had “the potential to disrupt the sustainability and independence of the local ISP industry”, said its chairman, Muhammad Arif Angg. 
 
Telkom, Indonesia's state-owned telecom giant, and the Indonesian Telecommunications Providers Association have also called for a level playing field in terms of regulations. 
 
Starlink “may appear aggressive” to these companies, causing them to feel insecure about how Starlink might expand, said Darynaufal Mulyaman, a lecturer at the International Relations Study Programme at Universitas Kristen Indonesia.
 
“Because on paper, it's a really unbalanced competition,” he said, noting that Starlink has minimal local staffing and does not contribute to Indonesia’s territorial network infrastructure.

The cost of Starlink remains high, however, and this is an obstacle to widespread adoption. Its residential package starts at 750,000 rupiah (US$45) per month, putting it only within the grasp of higher income earners. That is about double the cost of a local operator, not including installation costs. 
 
But as has occurred in other countries, the Starlink price could quickly drop as more users sign up.  
 
It also has plans sometime this year to offer mobile plans, which if permitted, would put the company in direct competition with other telecom providers for a lucrative market of hundreds of millions of customers. 
 
Its prices are far cheaper than other satellite internet providers, which prompted complaints from the Indonesia Satellite Association, which labelled Starlink’s offers “predatory”. The country’s anti-monopoly watchdog ruled last year that they were promotional, not unfair.

Governments will also have to manage the security and other risks that come with greater reliance on satellite internet providers. 
 
Experts raised concerns about the rising prominence of technology companies and their close ties to authorities. A case in point is Musk’s close relationship with the Trump administration, Sayudha said. 
 
He cited how Musk had suggested that he could stop Starlink’s operations in Ukraine.  
 
Ukrainian troops use Starlink extensively for battlefield communications and Musk wrote on the social media platform X in March that the Ukrainian army’s “entire front line would collapse if I turned it off"".  
 
It sparked a clash with Poland’s foreign minister, who said Poland pays for Ukraine’s Starlink terminals.  
 
Musk later wrote: ""To be extremely clear, no matter how much I disagree with the Ukraine policy, Starlink will never turn off its terminals."" 
 
For countries facing disasters, conflict or economic challenges, the power dynamic is further stacked towards technology companies with services to offer, according to Allison Pytlak, senior fellow and director of the Cyber Program at the Stimson Center, a non-profit think tank. 
 
Countries without robust oversight or systems could find themselves overly dependent on a provider like Starlink, heightening the risk of the misuse of the technology, she said. 
 
She argued that it should raise more questions about, and oversight of, the roles and responsibilities of internet service providers and other tech firms.  
 
“These tech companies, they're private actors, but they're kind of sitting at the table with governments because they’re providing services that governments normally would provide,” she said. 
 
“It’s obvious we're more and more dependent on all of these things. So, they should have a seat at the table, but we haven't quite worked out what the rules of the road are for them.”",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/starlink-southeast-asia-scam-industry-elon-musk-5113581,2025-05-17T12:58:06Z
channelnewsasia,"More digital nomads calling Bali home, but this comes at a price for the island and locals","DENPASAR, Bali: As snow began to thicken and cripple the day-to-day life of her friends and family back in Moscow, Daria Ivanova was packing her suitcase with sandals, summer dresses and bathing suits.

Since January, the 23-year-old social media consultant has been spending her nights at a rented room just minutes away from the beaches of Bali and her days running a small consultancy firm from a nearby co-working space.

“There’s a growing community of digital nomads and remote workers here (in Bali). So being here has been good for building a network and picking up new ideas,” Ivanova told CNA, adding that she also welcomes the change of pace and setting from her hometown in Russia.

“Every afternoon, I can stroll around the beaches and every weekend, I can travel and explore other parts of Bali.”



The idea of moving to Bali permanently has been on her mind for the last two-and-a-half years, since she first set foot on the island, famed for its stunning landscape and unique culture.

“I have worked from seven different countries but none of them comes close to beating Bali,” she said.

Remote working is becoming increasingly popular in a post-COVID-19 pandemic world, with more and more people aspiring to travel and become digital nomads like Ivanova.

According to a 2023 study by remote working consultancy firm, MBO Partners, there were 35 million digital nomads around the world, a 131 per cent increase compared to before the pandemic.

But experts and activists have blamed the influx of digital nomads for over-tourism and soaring property prices in many places around the world.

Southeast Asian hotspots like Thailand’s Phuket or Malaysia’s Langkawi saw an average of 8 per cent and 4 per cent hikes in property values respectively in 2024.

But even they pale in comparison to Bali’s capital Denpasar which according to several brokerage firms saw a 15.1 per cent rise in property values last year.

Property is in such high demand that sleepy agricultural villages are being transformed into boom towns filled with upscale restaurants and modern-looking villas.

The steep hike is partly why Ivanova is still hesitant about calling Bali her second home.

“When I first came to Bali, everything was cheap. Now, I spend almost the same amount of money as I do in Moscow,” she said.

Despite the development, very few locals are reaping the benefits. And as the influx of digital nomads drives prices up, some Balinese are feeling priced out, fuelling friction between the locals and remote-working expats.

“Houses have become out of reach for us Balinese,” said Bali resident Nyoman Denny.

Last year, Bali saw a 40 per cent increase in the number of digital nomads residing on the island compared to 2023. It is estimated that over 3,000 digital nomads now live there, according to the number of digital nomad visas granted annually.

While these numbers might not seem overwhelming for an island around eight times the size of Singapore with a population of around 4.4 million, it is possible that this is a gross-underestimation as it is possible to enter for a month on a tourist visa, which can then be renewed for an additional 30 days.

Some nationalities are exempt and do not require a visa at all.

The first wave of digital nomads came to Bali in the 2010s as high-speed internet was no longer confined to the downtown areas of major cities and began to penetrate smaller towns and suburbs.

“For these digital nomads, it is a lot cheaper to achieve the lifestyle that they want in Bali compared to where they come from,” Hansen Tandiyanto, the owner of Bali-based co-working space chain, Biliq, told CNA.

“Another reason is that Bali already had strong expat communities. It is easy for them to find someone who comes from the same country, speaks the same language and shares the same culture. So for them, Bali feels like a home away from home.”

The early wave of digital nomads was dominated by people in the technology industry and stock brokers, Hansen said. “Then the (COVID-19) pandemic happened and everyone realised that they can work from anywhere,” he said.

At the same time, Bali – an island where 80 per cent of its economy is linked to the tourism sector – was completely devastated.

According to the Bali manpower agency, at least 78,000 people lost their livelihoods at the height of the pandemic as hundreds of hotels, restaurants and shops had to stop operating temporarily or permanently.

With occupancy down to almost zero, hotel and villa owners began offering significant discounts in a bid to generate what little income they could.

“I was seeing villas which would have cost two million rupiah (US$119) a night being offered at two million rupiah per week or even per 15 days,” Febby Ayu, a 34-year-old accountant who moved to Bali from Jakarta told CNA.

The offer, made between 2020 and 2021 when countries around the world were still closing their borders, managed to convince hundreds of people from other Indonesian cities to temporarily reside in Bali.

“My office understood that where I work did not affect my productivity,” Febby said. “Although I have to admit that sometimes when I was at work all I could think about was ‘when can I hit the beach?’.”

But the massive price cut did not last long. In fact, prices started rising in January 2022 when Indonesia began to loosen its borders and offered a special visa for digital nomads.

Known formally as the C1 special visit visa, the pass allows foreigners to stay in the country for up to 60 days, which can be renewed twice. Applicants must among other criteria prove that they are employed at a company based outside of Indonesia and pay a one million rupiah application fee.

Holders of the visa are barred from making a living in Indonesia although they can still earn a salary by working remotely for businesses and clients based outside the country.

Apart from the C1 visa, other visas available include the tourist visa, valid for 30 days, and the E33G remote work visa, which allows for multiple entries and a stay of up to 12 months, for employees of non-Indonesian companies earning at least US$60,000 a year.

“Suddenly, rent became three to four times what they were during the pandemic,” Febby said, adding that over the last four years she had to move three times because she could no longer afford to live in her property.

While Febby can always go back to Jakarta, the same cannot be said for locals in Bali.

“We have to rent houses in the suburbs or another town altogether because we cannot afford to live in Denpasar anymore,” hotel clerk Ni Wayan Laksmi told CNA. “How are we supposed to compete with foreigners who are paid in dollars?”

Skyrocketing prices are not the only problem.

Around Denpasar, villas, retail spaces, bars and restaurants have sprung up, turning remote villages into boom towns.

“A few years ago, rice fields used to stretch as far as the eye can see. Now, there are only small patches of rice fields left which are completely surrounded by houses and buildings,” Bali resident Wayan Aditya, told CNA.

Before the digital nomad craze, Aditya said, tourists largely stuck to hotels and hostels. But most remote workers prefer the privacy and spaciousness offered by rented villas.

With the prospect of earning thousands of dollars each month, wealthy landowners began converting their rice fields into villas for rent. Those without capital to build rental homes are selling their vacant plots of land to investors from overseas or other parts of Indonesia.

The COVID-19 pandemic added fuel to the fire. “People were selling their land because they had no choice. Bali is so reliant on tourism we had no other income,” Aditya continued.

According to property monitoring company AirDNA, there are currently 83,500 properties available for rent in Bali and the number has been growing by between 20 and 27 per cent every year.

Meanwhile, public infrastructure such as roads and drainage systems are struggling to keep up with this massive scale of development, leading to worsening traffic congestion and flooding.

“Bali is getting more crowded but the roads are not getting any bigger. Traffic is so bad, sometimes it takes two hours just to cover a distance of less than 10km,” transportation expert Djoko Setijowarno told CNA.

“Meanwhile, public transportation in Bali is virtually non-existent, forcing tourists to take taxis or rent a vehicle.”

Bali is trying to address its crippling traffic by building a 33km light rail transit (LRT) network. The first two lines, which will connect Denpasar’s Ngurah Rai Airport with Cemagi beach in the north and Nusa Dua in the south, are expected to open by 2031.

Meanwhile, flooding is worsening as more and more land is being converted into settlements and buildings. On Feb 12, several streets and neighbourhoods in the greater Denpasar area were inundated by waist-high water. Dozens of foreigners were trapped inside their villas and had to be evacuated using life rafts.

For Christian Moser, a 60-year-old IT consultant from Germany, Bali is slowly losing its charm.

“I have seen a lot of development in Bali which is not sustainable. The quiet life, the view, the lush green rice fields, they are slowly going away or being spoiled by pollution and waste,” Moser, who has lived intermittently in Bali as a digital nomad for the last two years, told CNA.

As more foreigners decide to live in Bali as digital nomads, friction with locals becomes unavoidable.

In September of 2022, eight months after Indonesia introduced the digital nomad visa, an online petition emerged to repeal the policy.

The petitioners argued that some nomads have been disrespectful towards local customs and traditions, including staging late night parties, driving under the influence of alcohol and getting into brawls with locals or other foreigners. At least 8,000 signed the petition.

“The problem is not everyone who claims to be digital nomads are actually professionals working remotely. Many are just influencers looking to create tasteless content,” tourism expert Azril Azhari said.

“The government needs to be more selective in issuing the digital nomad visa.”

Tjok Bagus Pemayun, chief of the Bali tourism agency admitted that “the regulation must be strengthened” so that the visa is issued to those who deserve it. The island is currently in talks with the Immigration Ministry in Jakarta to work out the details of the planned amendment, he said.

However, Pemayun disagreed with the petitioners that the policy should be repealed entirely.

“Bali needs long-staying tourists with money to spend. They were the reasons why our economy stayed afloat during the COVID-19 pandemic,” he told CNA.

“The government also feels that working remotely is now becoming the norm. Working while holidaying is no longer the privilege of a few people in certain sectors. We must capitalise on this trend.”

Pemayun admitted that the policy has contributed to the over-development of some areas in Bali.

“Which is why we are trying to develop areas which are under-developed, so there won’t be an over-concentration of tourism in one part of Bali,” he said.

Experts said Indonesia should also look at other areas outside of Bali and see if they too can become hubs for digital nomads.

“Other countries have multiple tourism hubs. Meanwhile, for Indonesia, most tourists only know Bali and care little about visiting other places,” tourism expert Azril said.

“This is why the impact of digital nomads on over-tourism is felt more in Bali compared to places like Bangkok or Kuala Lumpur.”

Although there is no official figure, some media outlets and research firms estimated that there could be tens of thousands of digital nomads in Thailand, making it one of the world’s most popular destinations for remote workers.

These nomads are spread among several popular tourist destinations in the country like Bangkok, Phuket and Chiang Mai.

Malaysia attracted some 1,500 digital nomads last year, 73 per cent of whom chose to stay close to the country’s bustling capital, Kuala Lumpur. However, there is a growing number of remote workers choosing to stay in tourist favourites like Penang and Langkawi.

“As for Indonesia, tourists only know Bali because Indonesia is not doing enough to promote other destinations,” tourism expert Azril said.

Of the almost 14 million international tourists who came to Indonesia last year, 5.5 million arrived via Bali’s Ngurah Rai Airport. In contrast, Jakarta’s Soekarno Hatta Airport last year welcomed 2.1 million international travellers.

Since 2016, Indonesia has been trying to develop and promote 10 tourism destinations which it hopes will become “the new Bali”.

In 2023, the focus narrowed to five “super priority destinations”: North Sumatra’s Lake Toba; Central Java’s Borobudur; West Nusa Tenggara’s Mandalika; East Nusa Tenggara’s Labuan Bajo; and North Sulawesi’s Likupang.

But despite the efforts, their infrastructure and tourism ecosystems are nowhere as developed as Bali.

While it is possible to have high-speed internet access in even the remotest part of the globe using technology such as Elon Musk’s Starlink satellite-based network, some nomads still find it hard to stay away from Bali and move to these five destinations.

Tanay Mishra, an Indian-born digital marketing consultant, has been travelling all over the world as a digital nomad for the past 10 years. However, he kept coming back to Bali over and over again until eventually he decided a few years ago to permanently make the island his home.

“In Bali, you can find quiet beaches and bustling city centres just a few minutes drive from where you live. You will meet some of the friendliest people and have the best food,” the 35-year-old said.

“Yes, people complain about the traffic and how expensive everything is. But once you look past that, Bali will capture your heart and then you can never leave.”",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/more-digital-nomads-calling-bali-home-comes-price-island-and-locals-5104476,2025-05-17T12:58:06Z
channelnewsasia,"Indonesians queue overnight to buy gold amid economic uncertainty, but experts warn of risks","JAKARTA: When Resty Kinanthi arrived at a gold shop in South Jakarta at 8am on a recent weekday eager to buy a few grams of the precious metal, she was quickly turned away.

The 24-year-old, who is currently unemployed, had heard of the growing gold trend gripping the country in recent weeks so she turned up early, an hour before the shop opened.

Still, she was too late. A 50-person quota had been in place to buy gold since April and it was already full.

She went back the following day at 6am but it was the same story.



“I wondered: Why? At what time do people even arrive? I asked around and was told that a lot of people came the night before to get a number to queue for the quota,” she said.

With gold hitting an all-time high, an economic slowdown in Indonesia, and concerns about how United States President Donald Trump’s tariffs will affect the world’s economy, many Indonesians have been rushing to buy gold, even if it means queuing the night before the shop opens.

While gold fever has happened before in the country, most recently during the COVID-19 pandemic, the current craze has reached new heights, say experts, as they remind consumers to be cautious of the volatile economic situation.

In Indonesia, the queue to buy gold began slowly months ago when Trump was about to return to power, said economist Eko Listiyanto from the Institute for Development of Economics and Finance (INDEF). But it has intensified in recent weeks after Trump’s tariff announcement.

The US announced a 32 per cent tariff on imported Indonesian goods on Apr 2, which Trump declared “Liberation Day” due to the sweeping group of tariff announcements on various countries, before declaring a 90-day-pause on Apr 9 on “reciprocal” tariffs on imports from almost 60 countries.

After Liberation Day, the gold price globally and in Indonesia soared as it is widely seen as a safe haven hedge against the economic uncertainties caused by Trump's moves.

As of Apr 28, the global price of gold is about US$3,338 per ounce (around 28 grams), while in Indonesia it was 1.965 million rupiah (US$117) per gram.

This is about a 10 per cent increase compared to one month ago when it was 1.79 million rupiah.

Other countries in the region have also reported seeing symptoms of gold fever.

In Malaysia, some stores reported a 25 per cent increase in customers, according to local media.

Vietnam has also reported long queues outside stores to buy gold.

In Thailand, where gold also retains strong cultural significance, younger generations are entering the market through social media-driven financial advice. As a result, gold-trading apps and platforms are flourishing.

There were however no reports of people queuing overnight in these countries as seen in Indonesia.

While some people in Indonesia may understand that the high gold price is related to Trump’s Liberation Day, others may not, said Eko.

He added that as the cost of living in Indonesia has also gone up, people want to prepare for rainy days.

Furthermore, some people may still have money left from their Eid religious allowance, which employers handed to their staff towards the end of March, and they think it’s best to spend it on gold.

Eko said that many who queue for gold lately are young people such as Resty, and the high demand may be because Gen Z and millennials are financially more literate than older generations in Indonesia.

“Gen Z and millennials may not have a lot of money, but they are starting to invest earlier than previous generations,” Eko added.

He also said that because the two generations are digitally connected, they tend to have a heightened fear of missing out (FOMO).

Economist Fithra Faisal from securities brokerage firm Samuel Sekuritas Indonesia shared the same view.

He also said that because many Indonesians live from paycheck to paycheck, they want to gain an advantage from the current situation, as a hike in gold price seems like an easy way for them to buy and then resell quickly to profit.

“Because there is the potential that the gold price will increase further - three weeks ago it was 1.7 million rupiah per gram, then 1.8 million rupiah, then 1.9 million, then 2 million, they want to benefit from it.”

Besides Gen Z and millennials, some who queue are women from older generations.

Fithra said that these women from lower-income groups may not have a bank account, and their way to save up is by buying gold.

Social researcher Devie Rahmawati from the University of Indonesia said that, generally, gold has played a crucial role in Indonesian society for a long time.

In many Indonesian cultures, older generations grew up being told to have gold, not just as an investment, but also as a symbol of social status.

“Gold is a symbol of prosperity, power, and happiness,” said Devie.

“This is perhaps nowadays replaced by the cars people use or their mobile phones, but the older generation, especially women, tend to have gold and even pass theirs down to the next generation.”

However, places to purchase gold are limited.

In Southeast Asia’s largest economy, gold bullion - gold in the form of bars or coins - is mainly sold by the state-owned mining company Aneka Tambang (ANTAM), which has only a few shops in Jakarta and a few other major cities in Indonesia.

There are only a handful of smaller ones, and most people prefer ANTAM gold as the London Bullion Market Association guarantees it and it is easier to resell.

While not many options for people to buy bullion gold in its physical form exist, ANTAM could struggle to meet the demand, said observers.

“ANTAM cannot just suddenly increase its production,” said Eko.

“This makes the queues long.”

ANTAM told CNA it aims to make the metal available as much as possible.

It currently has five outlets in Jakarta and about 15 nationwide.

""We have anticipated this condition by strengthening the supply chain and optimising our distribution network, including our boutiques in various regions, and also presenting a digital solution for purchasing gold through ANTAM’s application,"" said ANTAM corporate secretary Faisal Alkadrie.

While acknowledging the increase in gold demand, he did not reveal figures on this or on how much ANTAM sells daily.

Economist Eko also said that the situation in Indonesia could be the same in regions with similar cultural attitudes towards gold and economic conditions, citing India as an example.

However, Fithra from Samuel Sekuritas Indonesia said that people are probably not queuing overnight to buy gold in developed countries, where it is often bought digitally, and stored in an account.

Gold is also available online in Indonesia but most people prefer to buy bullion gold because they perceive it as safer from digital fraud, since online attacks are not uncommon in the archipelago.

Undeterred by her two failures, Resty went to the same ANTAM boutique for the third time on Apr 22, this time at 9pm.

When she arrived, there were already other hopeful buyers.

She discovered that a system had been put in place in the name of fairness: They all list their name down on a piece of paper in order of who arrives first, and treat it as an unofficial attendance list.

When the security officer arrived at 7am the next day he created an official list and handed out a number for them to queue, according to the quota set for that day.

That list is based on the unofficial attendance list, but the officer will first check to see if the person is still there.

Since some live far away or are afraid that their names will be skipped, they opt to spend the night at ANTAM, staying awake all night or sleeping in a sitting position.

When Resty arrived that evening, she was number 19 on the unofficial attendance list.

She decided to stay at the closed shop until past midnight, afraid that someone would delete her name, and then went home, returning at 4am.

When the security officer arrived in the morning and created an official attendance list, she was thrilled to find out she got number 17, as two people were not present.

Resty, who previously worked as a social media administrator, said gold is the easiest form of investment because it doesn't require much comprehension, unlike buying stocks.

“The current inflation is telling me that I need to invest. Nobody told me to do this (buy gold).

“(But) at the moment, there is a trade war between one country and another, which is likely to increase inflation and weaken the currency (rupiah),” said Resty, referring to the trade tensions between the US and China.

She had bought gold for the very first time eight months before, at about 1.4 million rupiah for one gram. On the day CNA interviewed her, ANTAM sold one gram of gold at 1.995 million rupiah.

Resty bought two bullion gold bars, each weighing five grams.

Online clothes seller Nina Ramdayani, 30, had already bought gold on Apr 22 but went again the next day because she wanted to have as much gold as possible.

She arrived at 10pm the night before and stayed at ANTAM all night.

She managed to buy three gold bullions of 25 grams each on her second day, whereas the day before, all that was left for her to buy were three gold bullions of 10 grams.

“I am happy. My attempt to wait all night long has paid off,” she told CNA in a sleepy voice after just getting hold of the gold.

Nina returned to the same ANTAM boutique on Apr 24, for the third time and again bought three gold bullions of 10 grams.

Some rush to buy gold with the aim of reselling it, such as Achmad Faathir, who is based in Sukabumi, West Java.

Since his wage as a translator has been recently slashed, Achmad wanted to sell the three-gram gold bullion he bought in 2021 as the price is currently high and he needs the money.

Sukabumi has no ANTAM shop, and since Achmad happened to be in Jakarta for personal matters, the stars aligned for him to resell his gold.

Achmad arrived at 8am on Apr 23 and got number six.

The gold craze is likely to continue as long as the gold price rises and the global economic outlook remains uncertain, economists said.

“If the global economy remains uncertain, gold prices will remain high,” said economist Fithra.

Veronica Kaihatu, a psychology lecturer at Pembangunan Jaya University in South Tangerang, said gold will remain a favourite metal among Indonesians due to cultural perceptions but the gold craze will likely decrease when people feel more secure about the economy.

“So this depends on social, political and economic conditions.”

Social researcher Devie from the University of Indonesia said that the gold madness provides a form of financial security.

Should one decide to buy gold jewellery, especially if one is unable to purchase bullion, then it is also good since it can be worn.

However, she said people should know where to save the gold because it is not safe in Indonesian homes, which are prone to disasters such as flooding and theft.

“Do you have a safe deposit box at the bank? If yes, put it there, not at home,” she said.

Financial planner Mike Rini from financial consultant Mitra Rencana Edukasi said all investment forms have their risks, including gold.

She said gold could be a good investment tool if the price is not volatile.

“Even though in the long term gold price tends to go up, it could also be volatile, going up and down between days.

“So to me it is good when it is meant for the long term,” said Mike.

“It is not meant to generate passive regular income.”

She added that people should diversify their assets into five different types, such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, savings accounts, deposits, and possibly even properties and businesses.

They should also conduct research before buying gold, rather than just buying it based on instinct.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/indonesia-gold-prices-soar-economic-uncertainty-5096191,2025-05-17T12:58:06Z
channelnewsasia,Oil giant ConocoPhillips' pullout from US$3.1b Sarawak project a fallout of state's rift with Petronas,"KUALA LUMPUR: A protracted rift between Malaysia’s national oil corporation Petronas and the Sarawak state government appears to be causing investor disquiet following a surprise withdrawal by United States oil firm ConocoPhillips from an oil project off the Borneo coast.

In a little-publicised surprise move this month, ConocoPhillips decided to withdraw from operating the Salam-Patawali deepwater oil and gas field that the company discovered in 2018 with Petronas in a 50-50 joint venture that was expected to cost RM13.7 billion (US$3.13 billion).

The withdrawal was first reported by Upstream Online, a widely tracked industry news resource, on Apr 15 but has otherwise gone unreported in Malaysia media.

Two industry sources close to ConocoPhillips separately confirmed the pullout with CNA. They added that the move was part of a “country strategy review”, which the company did not elaborate on.



Efforts by CNA to reach company executives in its Kuala Lumpur office were unsuccessful as telephone calls went unanswered.

Industry executives told CNA that ConocoPhillips’ move was in part driven by the uncertain regulatory environment arising from the spat between Petronas and the state government headed by Premier Abang Johari Openg.

The Sarawak government, which owns oil and gas firm Petroleum Sarawak or Petros, is demanding greater control over its resources.

The industry executives with close ties with ConocoPhillips said that the company would now be focusing on its activities in neighbouring Sabah, where it already has operations.

“The sentiment is that foreign companies are uncomfortable because they see that Petronas is under pressure in Sarawak and the oil company (Petronas) is often the joint-venture partner in many exploration projects,” said a senior executive of a Western oil contracting firm based in the capital Kuala Lumpur.

According to ConocoPhillips’ factsheet on its Asia Pacific operations dated April 2024, it has exploration, development and production activities across about 2.7 million net acres in Malaysia.

Net acres refer to the amount of leased real estate that a company holds, pertaining to its working interest.

It has working interests in six production sharing contracts in Malaysia, and Petronas is listed as a “co-venturer” in all six contracts.

The Salam-Patawali exploration block encompasses 300,000 net acres primarily in the Salam and Benum fields off southern Sarawak.

“The company continues to evaluate the block and information from prior well results. A 3D seismic survey was acquired in 2023, and processing and evaluation of this data is currently ongoing,” it stated.

Typically, under production sharing contracts signed with Petronas, private oil companies surrender rights to oil fields back to the Malaysian oil corporation should they decide to discontinue exploration and production plans.

Industry executives noted that the latest move by ConocoPhillips comes on the heels of another review by a foreign firm.

Upstream Online reported in February that Thailand’s PTTEP – the exploration arm of its national petrochemical firm PTT – is re-engineering the Lang Lebah gas project off Sarawak shore “to improve the economic viability of the project”.

PTTEP has a 42.5 per cent share in the Lang Lebah project, according to a factsheet on its website dated Dec 31, 2024.

The development cost of the project has been reported to be about US$6 billion.

Sources told CNA that PTTEP temporarily suspended the development of the project and has postponed the final decision until sometime next year.

The spat between Sarawak and Petronas isn’t only hurting foreign investor sentiment in Malaysia’s robust oil and gas sector. It has also attracted allegations of corporate espionage.

Former Petronas manager Khairul Akmal Jasni pleaded not guilty in a Sessions Court in Kuala Lumpur on Apr 18 to charges that he had attempted to leak highly confidential information in June last year on the national oil corporation’s inner workings to Petros.

Cases of corporate spying are extremely rare in Malaysia and the allegations that Khairul had sought to share a document titled “Q1 2024 Upstream Business Performance, Operational & Financial” underscore the rising stakes in Sarawak's quest to break the national oil corporation’s monopoly.

The latest twists are also putting pressure on Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim to press both Sarawak and Petronas to reach a solution at a time when the country is grappling with growing headwinds to the economy due to uncertainties from the US’ campaign on global tariffs.

A senior aide to Anwar, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that the premier had been briefed by top Petronas officials on the status of the dispute with Sarawak.

“No change. Both parties are in a holding pattern with both holding firm to their positions,” said the aide.

A senior Petronas official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also confirmed that talks with the Sarawak government have not progressed.

Sarawak is challenging the decades-old monopoly Petronas has held since it was incorporated under a parliamentary statute in 1974 known as the Petroleum Development Act or PDA. The PDA, among other things, decrees that the national oil corporation is the sole guardian of the nation’s hydrocarbon reserves.

Sarawak, whose probable and proven reserves of petroleum represent 60.87 per cent of Malaysia's total and which accounts for 90 per cent of Malaysia’s liquified natural gas (LNG) exports, is insisting that PDA does not apply to the state.

Instead, it wants all the hydrocarbon reserves in Sarawak to be regulated under a colonial-era Oil Mining Ordinance 1958 that stipulates that oil and gas resources found within 200 nautical miles of its waters belong to the state.

Both parties have tried to reach a compromise in talks that began sometime in April last year, but talks have broken down twice, with Petronas suspending all negotiations in December, according to executives from the national oil corporation.

Requests to Premier Abang Johari’s office and Petros for comment were declined.

ConocoPhillips is a major player in Malaysia’s oil and gas sector and its pullout from the Salam-Patawali discovery, which is currently at the feasibility stage, represents a serious setback for the Sarawak economy.

It is unclear how much money ConocoPhillips and Petronas have spent on the Salam-Patawali field, known as the WL4-00 block, at this stage.

Offshore Technology, a widely used resource for the oil and gas sectors, noted development costs for the Salam-Patawali oil fields were pegged at RM13.7 billion, with production set to peak in 2028.

ConocoPhillips and Petronas had also envisaged working the area until the field reaches its economic limit in 2067.

The other production sharing contract operated by ConocoPhillips in Sarawak is known as the SK304 block that encompasses 1.1 million net acres. Exploration there remains at the feasibility stage.

ConocoPhillips' move to withdraw from the Salam-Patawali project highlights the growing complexities facing the oil and gas sector in Sarawak.

The dispute between Petronas and Petros has already produced legal skirmishes in recent months.

The first legal challenge was filed by Petros against Petronas in mid-October at the Kuching High Court over the national corporation’s demand for payment of RM7.05 million tied to a bank guarantee under a gas sales agreement signed in end-December 2019.

In court documents reviewed by CNA, Petros is arguing that the 2019 gas sales agreement is “illegal and void” because Petronas failed to obtain the “necessary licence” under the Distribution and Gas Ordinance enacted by the state in 2016.

Petros added that honouring the RM7.05 million claim would be “endorsing and furthering an illegal agreement”.

In a separate dispute, a Malaysian unit of international oil giant Shell obtained an interim order in January from the Kuala Lumpur High Court to temporarily suspend payment on natural gas supplies from the Bintulu gas facility in Sarawak.

The High Court granted an interim injunction to Shell MDS Malaysia Sdn Bhd to continue its operations without any disruption in supply until the legal tussle between Petronas and Petros is resolved.

While ongoing petroleum projects in Sarawak, such as the Bintulu gas facility, remain operational, several industry executives noted that the ongoing faceoff between Abang Johari’s administration and Petronas could dampen investor sentiment on the oil and gas sector in the Borneo state.

They noted that Petros, which was formed in August 2017, lacks the technological expertise and international experience that Petronas’s exploration arm Carigali possesses.

“Petros and the Sarawak-based E&P (exploration and production) companies don’t have the capabilities yet and that does not make them attractive partners without Petronas in the mix,” said the chief executive of a listed Malaysian engineering company with a long relationship with the national oil corporation.

He added that Sarawak’s immediate challenge is whether it can quickly  “find a replacement contractor for (the) Salam-Patawali” oil field.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/malaysia-sarawak-petronas-conocophillips-withdrawal-oil-project-investor-sentiment-5089371,2025-05-17T12:58:06Z
channelnewsasia,"Selangor, Perak turf clubs fight for horse racing’s future in Malaysia – with pickleball courts and car showroom","KUALA LUMPUR: When P Arumugam received his licence to be a horse trainer at the Penang Turf Club in August 2023, he was over the moon.

He had grown up in the club's quarters as his parents were employees there. Following in their footsteps, he joined the industry and, over 30 years, has gone from being a labourer to track supervisor, then assistant trainer and licenced trainer.

News that Penang Turf Club, Malaysia's oldest horse racing club, is set to close its doors after its final race on May 31 has left the 47-year-old father-of-two reeling.

“It is a bad feeling. I felt that I was never given a chance (to be a trainer),” he told CNA in a phone interview.



He had invested significantly to become a trainer, paying licensing fees, stable costs and other operational expenses. Starting with 20 horses, he now oversees only two. His investments, he laments, are ""all gone"".

“What other job can I do? I am nearly 50,” said Arumugam, whose children are aged seven and 14. “I cannot just simply pack up and go anywhere. It is not an easy process … Now, I must start all over again.”

The Penang Turf Club's impending closure follows horse racing’s decline in the region. The 182-year-old Singapore Turf Club held its final race in October 2024, and the Macau Jockey Club ceased operations in April last year.

The sport faces similar headwinds in many other countries like Australia and the United States as it grapples with issues such as illegal betting, animal welfare, high cost of operations and competition from other forms of gambling and entertainment.

With the Penang Turf Club's closure, Malaysia will have two remaining ones: Perak Turf Club, established in 1886, and the Selangor Turf Club, founded in 1896.

Industry insiders told CNA that the closure of the clubs in Penang and Singapore will benefit the players left standing, but critical questions remain about the long-term future of horse racing in Malaysia.

The Penang Turf Club, occupying about 81.7 hectares of prime land in Batu Gantung on Penang Island, faced inevitable closure, according to an industry insider who noted longstanding development plans for the site.

The lack of races over the past few years, coupled with a dwindling horse population, further contributed to the decision, said the insider.

""You must have enough horses to achieve a healthy race day, which is about eight races at least. Unfortunately, they didn’t,"" said the insider, who declined to be named because he was not authorised to speak to the media.

His views were echoed by Selangor Turf Club's chairman Richard Cham, who cited the steady decline in the Penang club’s horse population without adequate replenishment as a key reason for the closure.
 
The shortage of horses made it increasingly difficult to sustain a full and competitive racing calendar, as a smaller field reduces the quality and excitement of the races, said Cham in a written response to CNA.

Penang Turf Club currently has only two trainers and eight horses in its stable.

“A strong and consistent number of runners is essential to maintaining the vibrancy and appeal of race meetings,” said Cham, adding that the situation reflected broader challenges faced by racing clubs in the region.

“Without enough horses to support regular, competitive events, it becomes challenging for a club to maintain momentum, attract new owners, and justify the significant operational costs associated with running a racecourse,” he said.

A main challenge faced by clubs, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic, was a drop in attendances and revenue. The Macau club, for example, racked up losses of US$310 million, according to a report by news agency AFP.

The Singapore Turf Club’s average attendance per race day declined from 11,000 in 2010 to 6,000 in 2019. After the COVID-19 pandemic, attendance was 2,600 per race day.

John Lim, chairman of Perak Turf Club, told CNA that its attendance of about 700 people during race days is a far cry from around 7,000 in its heyday back in the 1980s.

When he entered the sport back in 2007, the three turf clubs in Malaysia were able to generate about RM1 billion (US$232.6 million) in betting revenue a year, he said.

These days, annual revenue has fallen to about RM350 million, which Lim attributes to widespread illegal betting.

At the Malaysian clubs, the minimum legitimate bet is RM5, but Lim pointed out that some illegal websites offer lower minimum bets of RM4.20.

“A lot of the betting revenue has shifted to the illegal operators. We cannot control the illegal betting market out there,” he said in a phone interview.

Governments around the world impose taxes on betting to mitigate its negative social impact.

But illegal operators, circumventing regulations and taxes, are able to offer consumers better odds, according to a report on illegal betting markets last year by the Asian Racing Federation.

The federation comprises 28 national racing authorities and racing-related organisations from across Asia, Oceania, Africa and the Middle East.

Research has estimated that around 80 per cent of sports bets worldwide are made illegally and the United Nations estimated in 2021 the total amount bet annually may be as much as US$1.7 trillion.

Lim said the Perak Turf Club was losing money, but did not disclose figures.

“There are no thoughts about closing at the moment, but no business can survive if it loses money continuously. We just hope that it doesn’t come to that,” he added.

“People need to know that we are losing money mainly because there isn't enough revenue because of illegal betting. They have to change that mindset and support legitimate betting if they want the sport to continue,"" he added.

Curbing illegal gambling and its appeal is an uphill battle, however.

A regular punter at the Selangor Turf Club showed CNA an unauthorised website offering slightly higher winnings than the club and added: “These websites pay the money into your account almost immediately.”

After Singapore and Macau shuttered their racing clubs, Cham said some owners and trainers from both places relocated their horses to Selangor and Perak. Selangor has over 800 horses currently while Perak has 188.

This presents an opportunity for growth, and his club is now focused on expanding into international markets, said Cham.

“With the increasing recognition of the club's potential, there is a clear path forward to tap into global racing communities, attract international investors and broaden its audience base,” he said.

“This expansion not only promises to strengthen the club’s reputation but also to elevate the profile of Malaysian horse racing on the world stage.”

Selangor club is collaborating with international partners to telecast their races globally and attract new audiences, he said.

Races in Selangor are telecast “live” to turf clubs and various other platforms in Australia, New Zealand, North America, Singapore, United Kingdom, Ireland, India, and Turkiye.

The club, which is hosting 55 race days this year, has also increased its prize money from RM17.3 million in 2024 to a total of RM31 million, including RM3.7 million for feature races.

“This substantial increase not only provides greater incentives for participation but also demonstrates confidence in the future of the sport,” said Cham.

The club declined to disclose its operating costs or any profits or losses when asked by CNA.

The club is also investing in infrastructure upgrades, such as improving drainage on the main track and building a new racing track. It is actively seeking more collaborations to secure a consistent pipeline of high-quality young horses.

Perak Turf Club’s Lim similarly sees opportunities in a less crowded Malaysian horse racing landscape.

“Singapore’s closure benefited Malaysia because horses and trainers from Singapore have to go somewhere else,” he said. Hundreds of horses were reportedly relocated to Malaysia after Singapore Turf Club’s closure.

With its current number of horses, Perak Turf Club is secure in racing terms for “at least three years”, he said.

But in the longer term, there is a need to bring in horses from places such as Australia so that the population is maintained, he said.

""We must consider drastic measures, focusing on either aggressively building our market share within horse racing itself, or exploring other avenues that can sustain us beyond just conducting horse races,"" he said.

Attracting younger fans to the “sport of kings” is crucial to cultivate a new generation of enthusiasts, said Rosalind Lim of the Malayan Racing Association (MRA), which promotes the interests of horse racing in Singapore and Malaysia.

“It’s still very much the old generation of fans and we have failed to attract the young audiences,” she said.

At a recent race day at the Selangor Turf Club, attendees appeared to be mainly elderly men. Most were glued to the television screens as races from Australia and South Africa were shown between races at the club that day.

One punter who only wanted to be known as Boon, 67, told CNA that he was at the races most weekends because it was fun.

“Just like how people watch football at the mamak restaurant or on big screens, it is much more exciting,” he said.

He agreed attendance has dropped significantly over time. “Many years ago, there was no place to even sit,” he said, gesturing at the many empty chairs and tables at the club.

There is also a stigma associated with horse racing due to its connection to gambling, said MRA’s Lim.

Both the Selangor and Perak clubs said they want the sport to transcend its association with betting.

Cham said Selangor club wants to position horse racing as a lifestyle and capitalise on the aspirations of individuals who dream of owning racehorses and achieving the thrill of victory when their horses win.

“This new approach focuses on the personal satisfaction and pride that comes with owning and nurturing a successful racehorse, creating a deeper emotional connection to the sport,” he said.

He added that the club was exploring a partnership to build a multi-sport complex and a luxury car showroom cafe.

The Perak Turf Club has already embarked on its transformation.

It is investing about RM6.5 million in new facilities such as a swimming pool and gymnasium, as well as tennis, badminton and pickleball courts.

While horse racing remains its core activity, Lim said the club aims to evolve into a broader leisure and entertainment destination.

“People don’t know horse racing is still going on. We want to open the club for the larger community to enjoy,” he said.

The club also hopes to begin operating dining and retail facilities by this year, said Lim.

“The perception is that these clubs are gambling dens, but we are trying to soften the image of horse racing so that more people can embrace it over time,” he said.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/malaysia-horse-racing-turf-clubs-selangor-perak-singapore-penang-survival-lifestyle-5109626,2025-05-17T12:58:06Z
channelnewsasia,Innovative or ‘dangerous’? Indonesia’s local leaders raise eyebrows with vasectomy-for-aid and other schemes,"JAKARTA: Wearing green uniforms and hats resembling those of the Indonesian army, dozens of teenage boys lined up neatly in the middle of a field in Purwakarta, West Java, shouting: “Ready, ready, ready! Awesome! Let’s keep up the spirit!”

One could be forgiven for thinking they were soldiers-in-training but they were, in fact, Indonesian junior high school students who had been deemed delinquent undergoing a 14-day boot camp.

West Java governor Dedi Mulyadi, who introduced the programme, believes it is the military who can discipline these students.

He has allocated 6 billion rupiah (US$363,590) for it and aims for up to 2,000 students to take part.



The programme, which makes use of regional military posts and involves the Indonesian military and national police, has prompted criticism from some lawmakers and rights groups, who question if this is the right way to educate children.

But Dedi has brushed off the criticism.

“If you are a leader, you must be as firm as a rock,” he told reporters on May 3 when asked about the controversy.

“If you have thoughts and ideas, never give up,” he said while visiting the students in Purwakarta.

Dedi is not the only local leader in Indonesia whose new programmes have been met with scepticism.

Like him, several others have stoked debate since Indonesia elected 961 governors, regents and mayors on Nov 27 last year and swore them in on Feb 20.

Besides his training programme for supposedly delinquent youths, Dedi has also made headlines for suggesting that husbands who want to receive social handouts undergo a vasectomy to ensure they do not have more children and increase poverty.

It is also a way for men to participate in family planning as the “burden should not fall solely on women”, he said.

With a population of about 50 million, West Java is Indonesia’s most populous province, and about 7.5 per cent of its inhabitants live in poverty.

“If people cannot afford childbirth, pregnancy, and education expenses, then they should not yet pursue parenthood,” said Dedi.

He offered 500,000 rupiah in cash incentives to those who agree to undergo vasectomy and said: ""This is not coercion, but an invitation for shared responsibility. We provide incentives, not just empty appeals.”

His plan has drawn mixed reactions from the public, Islamic figures as well as ministers. Some have called it discriminatory, while others have said it is a violation of one’s autonomy.

In neighbouring Jakarta, governor Pramono Anung has made it mandatory for civil servants to use public transport on Wednesdays since Apr 30 and to take a selfie as evidence.

The programme aims to combat the capital’s notorious traffic congestion and air pollution.

But so far, there has been no sanction against the 50,000 civil servants who have not obeyed the rule.

Pramono also plans to dedicate an island in Jakarta’s Thousand Islands regency for cats to solve the capital’s ever-growing stray cat problem.

According to Jakarta’s government, the city has about 860,000 stray cats, possibly even 1.5 million. Meanwhile, Jakarta’s population is about 11 million people.

The government said an island of the Thousand Islands would be transformed into a tourist destination, creating local jobs.

""If we can make it happen, then it can also be a (source of) revenue for the Thousand Islands, for people to come and enjoy cat tourism,” Pramono told local media on Mar 13.

Over in Sulawesi, the regent of Gorontalo, Sofyan Puhi, in April banned transgender women from singing on stage during events, sparking protests from some transgender groups.

Gorontalo’s government said this is in response to public complaints that claim transgender performers violate Indonesia’s social norms.

Indonesia’s regional autonomy law gives local leaders the authority to implement their own programmes.

In the first 100 days of their term, it is not surprising that some leaders are trying to be innovative and introduce schemes that appear to be populist, said public policy expert Trubus Rahadiansyah of Jakarta’s Trisakti University.

This is because they want to convince people that they are capable and increase their popularity, particularly if they wish to seek re-election in 2029.

“Such programmes could significantly affect their popularity,” said Trubus.

“And this must be done early, so the public is convinced they have a good leader who keeps his campaign promises. If the leaders introduce programmes later on, the public may not be bothered anymore (to learn about their programmes).”

However, Trubus said leaders should remember Prabowo’s goals and, most importantly, develop comprehensive plans that are well thought-out and aligned with the president’s.

Prabowo’s targets are summed up in his eight visions and missions, Asta Cita, which include strengthening democracy, the country’s Pancasila ideology and human rights, strengthening national defence and security, creating jobs, and developing human resources and gender equality.

Asta Cita also includes a focus on downstreaming commodity supply chains so that Indonesia benefits more from its mineral resources, developing villages, political reforms and combating corruption, and creating a harmonious environment and religious tolerance.

“There should be a direct correlation between the regional leaders’ plans and the central government’s, the Asta Cita,” said Trubus.

To stay on the right track, leaders should actively consult relevant parties, said experts.

Trubus said regional leaders should ideally consult the interior ministry, which oversees the regional leaders, before implementing new programmes.

Ideally, regional leaders should also involve the public before introducing a new scheme to avoid controversy and appearing as though they are showing off regional superiority, he said.

The interior ministry should also be more proactive in contacting regional leaders and supervising them so they stay on the right track with their missions, as well as Prabowo’s.

“For example, the transgender ban (in Gorontalo) is against human rights. That is dangerous,” he added.

Political psychology expert Hamdi Muluk from the University of Indonesia said regional leaders should create evidence-based policies.

They can consult their subordinates who are experts on some issues, he said.

Alternatively, they can reach out to universities to conduct research before coming up with a new programme.

“For example, the boot camp military programme can be studied very carefully (with) a pedagogical, psychological approach, before being implemented,” said Hamdi.

“It would be better if policy creation were on a meritocratic or technocratic basis.”

Ultimately, economist Mohammad Faisal from think tank the Centre of Reform on Economics (CORE) Indonesia said there are many problems in the country, and Prabowo has many goals. Every region is also striving for economic growth.

On Monday, the Indonesian statistics agency said the country’s economy grew 4.87 per cent in the first quarter from a year earlier, its weakest growth rate in over three years.

It was down from 5.02 per cent in the previous quarter, and a far cry from Prabowo’s target to achieve 8 per cent economic growth annually.

“The main problem at the moment everywhere is economic problems, from lack of jobs to eradicating poverty – every region faces these problems,” said Faisal.

""The role of regional heads is not only to target short-term populist programmes or quick wins, but they should solve the root of the problems in their regions.”

He added that with the uncertain global economic outlook, which would affect Indonesia’s economy, the pressure is greater for regional leaders to excel.

There are also problems that are impossible for one region to tackle alone, he said.

""There must be synchronisation between regional policies and even collaboration between regions,” he said.

Indonesians like Jakartan Fita Destriyana, 30, want the government to create policies that directly benefit ordinary people.

“For example, if the government focuses on providing free and accessible education,” she said.

“In my neighbourhood Tanah Abang, there are still many school dropouts – even though Tanah Abang is near the presidential palace.""",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/indonesia-politics-regional-leaders-policies-vasectomy-delinquents-boot-camp-transport-cat-island-5119576,2025-05-17T12:58:06Z
