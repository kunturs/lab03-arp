DW,"UK, EU seek major reset of ties at London summit","The EU and UK are working towards a level of cooperation not seen since Brexit, with new agreements on fisheries, trade and security. Deals were agreed as British PM Starmer hosts EU leaders in London.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is hosting the leadership of the European Union (EU) at a summit in London on Monday, and has inked agreements calling for deepening defense and trade ties.

Starmer's office said Monday said the agreements are aimed at slashing red tape and growing the British economy.

""This is the first UK-EU summit,"" Starmer told reporters on Monday. ""It marks a new era in our relationship, and this deal is a win-win.""

An agreement on fisheries allows EU fishermen to have access to British waters for an extended period of 12 years in exchange for the EU indefinitely easing red tape on food and drink imports and exports.

The eased customs checks on food and plant products are expected to add ""nearly 9 billion pounds"" ($12 billion/€10.7 billion) to the British economy by 2040, Starmer's office said in a statement.

Downing Street also said a new defense and security pact with the EU deal ""will pave the way"" for the UK defense industry ""to participate"" in a €150 billion ($167-billion) defense fund being set up by the EU.

The UK government added the agreements included a ""youth experience scheme"" and more access for British passport holders to automated controls at EU borders.

Since taking office in July 2024, Starmer has pushed for what he calls a ""reset"" of ties with the EU.

Monday's summit, hosting European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, European Council President Antonio Costa and EU top diplomat Kaja Kallas, is the first of its kind in what the UK leader hopes will be annual summits working towards more formal cross-channel integration.

""It's time to look forward. To move on from the stale old debates and political fights to find common sense, practical solutions, which get the best for the British people,"" Starmer said as the summit got underway on Monday.

Von der Leyen called the new agreements a ""success"" and ""an historic moment.""

Since the UK formally left the EU in 2020 after the Brexit referendum in 2016, ties have mostly been governed under a ""Trade and Cooperation Agreement"" (TCA) negotiated by former conservative PM Boris Johnson and signed in December 2020.

Starmer, who had opposed Brexit from the center-left Labour party, has said ties can be improved to boost the UK economy and bolster security. The TCA is up for review in 2026, and deals on topics like fisheries are due to expire.

Since Brexit, common challenges facing the UK and EU include Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine and a more isolationist and tariff-ready US policy under President Donald Trump.

Fishing rights and youth mobility were sticking points in negotiations, with wrangling on details likely to continue beyond Monday.

EU officials speaking off the record to news agencies ahead of the summit said the bloc's member states green lit a ""common understanding"" with the UK on trade, fishing and youth mobility.

Fishing rights have been a constant sore spot in UK negotiations with the EU, with reports indicating that talks dragged on late Sunday night to hash out an agreement before Monday's summit.

Conservative opponents have said continuing to allow EU boats in British waters is a ""surrender"" to the EU that will harm local fisheries.

On the youth mobility agreement, Reuters news agency reported that the wording leaves the door open for more negotiation.

A pre-print seen by Reuters said the UK and EU ""should work towards a balanced youth experience scheme on terms to be mutually agreed.""

Detractors in the UK are concerned an agreement on youth mobility could open the door to the return of freedom of movement between the EU and UK.

Starmer's move towards more integration with the EU has drawn criticism from conservatives and the far-right.

In its election manifesto last year, Labour promised that it wouldn't rejoin the EU's single market and customs union, and free movement of people and goods.

In August 2024, Starmer said revamping agreements with the EU ""does not mean reversing Brexit or re-entering the single market or the customs union.""

DW,Iran summons British diplomat over arrest of nationals,"Iran summoned the British charge d'affaires to its foreign ministry in Tehran to protest the arrest of several Iranian nationals in Britain. The Iranians were arrested on charges related to terrorism and spying.

Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned a British envoy in Tehran over the arrest of Iranian nationals in the United Kingdom on charges of espionage, state media reported on Monday.

""Following the unjustified arrest of a number of Iranian nationals in the UK... the British charge d'affaires in Tehran was summoned on Sunday,"" Iran's IRNA news agency said.

British police held 7 Iranians earlier this month in two separate operations.

Of those, three men appeared in a London court on Saturday after being charged with engaging in conduct likely to assist a foreign intelligence service, that being Iran in their case.

According to the British Home Office, the men were irregular migrants who arrived in the UK between 2016 and 2022.

UK Police say that the alleged spying occurred from August 2024 to February 2025.

Meanwhile, the other four men — who were arrested on suspicion of preparation of a terrorist act — have been released from custody but they still face a probe.

Iran's state media quoted a foreign ministry official alleging that the arrests appeared to be led by ""political motives"" to ""exert pressure"" on the influential Middle Eastern nation.

The UK government has put Iran on the highest tier of its foreign influence register, requiring the Islamic Republic to register everything it does to exert political influence in Britain.

DW,Former US President Biden diagnosed with 'aggressive' cancer,"The 82-year-old Democrat was diagnosed with prostate cancer on Friday, his office has said. He served as president from 2021 to 2025 and abruptly ended his bid for reelection last July.

Former US President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an ""aggressive"" form of prostate cancer, his office said on Sunday.

""While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management,"" his office said.

Prostate cancers are ranked in terms of their severity on a scale of one to 10, in what is called a Gleason score.

Biden's prostate diagnosis has been given a Gleason score of nine, meaning it has metastasized to the bone, the statement said.

Biden, 82, is reviewing treatment options with his family, the statement added.

The Biden family has been impacted by the disease before. Biden's son, Beau, died of brain cancer in 2015.

Biden began his political career in 1972 when he was elected senator for the northeastern state of Delaware, a position in which he served six terms.

After serving as the 47th Vice President during Barack Obama's two terms between 2009 and 2017, Biden defeated incumbent Donald Trump to serve as president from 2021 to 2025.

He abruptly withdrew his bid for reelection in July 2024, amid concerns among Democrats and intense media scrutiny about his age, physical health and mental acuity, which peaked following a shaky televised debate against Trump.

Biden's former vice president Kamala Harris took over as Democratic Party's nominee but she was roundly defeated by Trump.

Biden was the oldest president in American history when he won the 2020 election, a record Trump, 78, broke four years later.

Biden's sucessor, Donald Trump, expressed sadness over the news in a post on his Truth Social platform.

""Melania and I are saddened to hear about Joe Biden's recent medical diagnosis. We extend our warmest and best wishes to Jill and the family, and we wish Joe a fast and successful recovery,"" Trump said.

Kamala Harris, who served as vice president under Biden, said she was keeping the former president in her family's ""hearts and prayers during this time.""

""Joe is a fighter — and I know he will face this challenge with the same strength, resilience, and optimism that have always defined his life and leadership,"" Harris said.

Former President Barack Obama, under whom Biden served as vice president, also expressed his well wishes.

""Nobody has done more to find breakthrough treatments for cancer in all its forms than Joe, and I am certain he will fight this challenge with his trademark resolve and grace. We pray for a fast and full recovery,"" Obama said.

DW,"Portugal election: Ruling AD wins, stays short of majority","With just four seats left to assign, the center-right Democratic Alliance had secured a 32.7% share of the vote, which means the party is short of a full majority. It is the third election in as many years in Portugal.

Portugal's ruling center-right Democratic Alliance (AD) won the most seats in Sunday's general election but again fell short of a ruling parliamentary majority, while support for the far-right Chega party rose, near complete official results showed. There are just four seats left to assign in Portugal's 230-seat parliament.

The AD took 32.7% of the vote, which would leave it short of the 42% required for an outright majority. The Socialist Party secured a 23.4% share of the vote, with the far-right Chega garnering 22.6%.

The AD secured 29% of the vote in the last election in 2024, but that minority government collapsed this year.

AD leader and acting prime minister Luis Montenegro has ruled out making any deal with Chega to form a coalition government.

The pro-business Liberal Initiative (IL) was poised to take between 4% and 8%.

The AD will likely have to forge deals with smaller parties in order to secure a majority of at least 116 seats in Portugal's 230-seat parliament.

A second consecutive minority government would dent hopes that this latest election could bring stability to Portugal, which is seeing the worst period of political turmoil in decades.

This is the third election in Portugal in three years.

Sunday's ballot was called just one year into the center-right minority government's term after  Montenegro failed to win a vote of confidence in parliament in March.

The confidence vote was proposed by Montenegro when the opposition questioned his integrity over the dealings of his family's consultancy firm.

Montenegro has denied any wrongdoing, and most opinion polls showed voters dismissing the opposition's criticism.

The far-right Chega party, which Montenegro refuses to deal with, is slated to over-perform the 18% of the vote it was predicted to win ahead of the election.

Exit polls suggest the last-minute health problems its leader Andre Ventura has suffered have not impacted its results.

After undergoing hospital treatment twice in the past week due to an esophageal spasm, he made a surprise appearance at his party's final event on Friday.

In the last election, Chega raised its seats in parliament from 12 to 50, owing much of its popularity to its demands for a tighter immigration policy.

This year's election has been dominated by issues such as housing and immigration. The vote follows a decade of fragile governments, only one of which has had a parliamentary majority but still collapsed halfway through its term.

Portugal has witnessed a steep rise in immigration. Fewer than 500,000 legal immigrants in the country in 2018, according to government statistics. However, by early this year, there were more than 1.5 million, many of them Brazilians and Asians working in tourism and farming.

Thousands more are undocumented, and the outgoing government announced two weeks before the election it was expelling some 18,000 foreigners living in the country unauthorized.

Similarly, a housing crisis has seen house prices and rents soaring for the past 10 years, partly due to an influx of white-collar foreigners who have driven up prices.

House prices jumped another 9% last year, the National Statistics Institute, a government body, said. Rents in and around the capital Lisbon, where some 1.5 million people live, saw the steepest rise in 30 years, climbing more than 7% last year, the institute said.

The problem is compounded by Portugal being one of Western Europe's poorest countries. The average monthly salary last year was around €1,200 ($1,340) before tax, according to the statistics agency. The government-set minimum wage this year is €870 ($974) a month before tax.

DW,Can India help Apple diversify away from China?,"Apple has traditionally relied heavily on Chinese factories to make its products. The tech giant is now planning to significantly boost production in India.

United Statestech giant Apple said this month that India would play a major role in making iPhones for the US market.

""A majority of iPhones sold in the US will have India as their country of origin,"" CEO Tim Cook said earlier in May while announcing the company's latest quarterly results.

He also noted that Vietnam would be producing nearly all iPads, Macs, Apple Watches and AirPods to be sold in the US.

The decision was aimed at mitigating the impact of US President Donald Trump's tariff onslaught on the tech giant's supply chains as well as sales and profit margins.

Apple shifting some more of its iPhone production to India presents not only a big opportunity but also some potential challenges, said Lekha Chakraborty, senior economist at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy.

""A nuanced analysis reveals potential challenges including cost competitiveness vis-a-vis China, labor market rigidities, and supply chain vulnerabilities,"" she told DW.

Chakraborty underscored that making iPhones in India is 5-10% more expensive, pointing to costlier parts and relatively inefficient factories.

""Furthermore, the fiscal implications of this investment warrant careful consideration, particularly in terms of tax revenues, infrastructure investments, and potential subsidies,"" said Chakraborty, adding that a ""calibrated policy approach would be essential to mitigate risks and maximize gains.""

An estimated 20% of iPhones are currently being made in India. According to Bloomberg, Apple produced $22 billion worth of iPhones in India in the 12 months through March 2025, marking a 60% jump from the prior year.

The US company plans to produce over 60 million iPhones annually in the South Asian country by 2026, doubling current output and significantly strengthening India's electronics manufacturing sector.

In India, iPhones are assembled by three primary contract manufacturers — Foxconn, Pegatron Corp and a Tata Group company that's formerly known as Wistron. Foxconn is the largest of the three, handling the majority of iPhone production in the South Asian nation.

The Indian government also recently announced a new policy aimed at strengthening the nation's electronics manufacturing ecosystem.

The production shift represents a significant change for Apple, which has traditionally relied heavily on Chinese factories to make its products.

But Trump's hefty duties on imports to the US, especially the tit-for-tat tariff exchanges with China, put the company in a difficult spot and forced it to rethink its strategy.

The US president has since granted a temporary reprieve for tech products, including smartphones and semiconductors. Washington and Beijing also agreed over the weekend to hit a 90-day pause on their tariff dispute.

To transition into a truly independent manufacturing hub for Apple, India will need to invest heavily in infrastructure, skills and technology, Shrijay Sheth, founder of LegalWiz.in, a consultancy firm, told DW.

""While it is a robust win for India business-wise and boosts its standing as a preferred destination for companies seeking business-friendly destinations, it adds yet another layer of complexity to the already dicey Indo-China relations,"" he said.

Sheth believes shifting a major chunk of production away from China to India will likely face impediments in terms of technology and expertise transfer.

""It is naive to hope that the Chinese expertise plus skill transfer and production machinery would be transferred with the required speed given the current geopolitical scenario and especially when China loses a significant source of manufacturing jobs,"" he stressed.

""How it will pan out on the ground is a big question when you factor the economics, skilled labor and how the supply chain will be rebuilt.""

Nikul Shah, co-founder and CEO of IndieSemic, which specializes in semiconductor and embedded systems, believes that India has the capacity to meet all iPhone demand in the future, but the ecosystem needs to be ramped up.

He stressed that increased iPhone production offers India an opportunity to increase its role in global electronics manufacturing networks.

""But success will depend on addressing persistent infrastructure and policy limitations that have historically constrained its manufacturing competitiveness,"" Shah underlined.

""While it aligns with the 'Make in India' initiative, potentially transforming the country into a global electronics manufacturing hub, it also introduces risks such as over-reliance on a single multinational company and potential geopolitical pressures.""

DW,Researchers: Extremism in Germany's military remains threat,"An internal survey about extremist attitudes in the German military now found that it does not have ""systemic"" extremism in the ranks. But some researchers are skeptical of the safeguards in place.

Fewer than 1% German soldiers harbor ""consistent right-wing-extremist attitudes,"" according to a new study conducted by the military's own Bundeswehr Center of Military History and Social Sciences (ZMSBw).

The study found that only 0.4% of soldiers show right-wing-extremist attitudes. Among the military's civilian personnel, the proportion is 0.8%, much less than the 5.4% measured in the general German population, the authors said.

The report did, however, find other problematic views among the soldiers: 6.4% have ""consistent chauvinist attitudes,"" and 3.5% have ""consistent xenophobic attitudes.""

In general, the study appears to be positive news, especially as the Bundeswehr has been dogged in recent years with well-documented stories of far-right networks and terrorist plots involving members of the military.

In 2022, a Bundeswehr lieutenant named Franco A. was convicted of planning to carry out an act ""threatening the security of the state"" while posing as a Syrian refugee. In 2017, a nationwide network of armed preppers suspected of planning a military coup was found to include several current and former soldiers. Some German media outlets have even spoken of a ""shadow army"" within the Bundeswehr that has been ignored by the military's intelligence service, the MAD.

""Yes, I would say the study does offer a certain amount of relief,"" one of the authors Markus Steinbrecher, told DW. ""But if you extrapolate the percentage — 0.4% — theoretically, we still have a high three-digit number of people in the army with extremist convictions.""

That broadly chimes in with the MAD's figures: Defense Ministry statistics say that, in 2023, the MAD was investigating 1,049 cases of suspected extremism in the armed forces, of which 776 were right-wing, 22 were left-wing, and 51 were Islamist. The Bundeswehr currently employs just over 260,000 people, including 180,000 soldiers and 80,000 civilian personnel.

For the new ZMSBw study, more than 4,300 interviews with military personnel were carried out in late 2022, as well as 18 small-group discussions at eight military bases across Germany.

Steinbrecher admitted that a study primarily based on voluntary surveys has its shortcomings. ""People can, of course, put their crosses anywhere, even if they have other opinions; we're aware of that,"" he said. ""That's why, at various stages we made various checks, in order to get behind an idea of how big the underestimate might be.""

To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video

However, some are skeptical about how useful the survey is. Anke Hoffstadt, a far-right extremism researcher at the University of Applied Sciences in Dusseldorf, said that the survey was academically sound but pointed out that the ZMSBw is part of the Bundeswehr itself.

""They are independent and fixed to scientific standards, but of course, they are within the structure they are looking at,"" Hoffstadt told DW.

Hoffstadt also said that the respondents may have been influenced by the timing of the surveys, in 2022 — in the wake of extra political scrutiny on right-wing extremism in the Bundeswehr and the police.

In 2020, then Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer disbanded an entire company of the elite KSK commando unit in the town of Calw after details of a notorious ""pig's head"" party emerged. At the party in 2017, soldiers allegedly showed Hitler salutes, hired sex workers, listened to far-right rock music, and flung pig's heads around.

Also in 2020, the Bundeswehr admitted that some 60,000 rounds of its ammunition were unaccounted for.

""So at that time, everyone in the Bundeswehr knows they're in the spotlight,"" Hoffstadt said. ""The study is not a failure, or in bad faith, but I would recommend a critical reading.""

The survey authors also said that people with right-wing extremist views ""show an increased interest in joining the armed forces"" — though that does not mean that they will find their way into the military. ""Being interested doesn't mean that they apply, and applying doesn't mean they will be accepted,"" as Steinbrecher put it.

Indeed, there are significant hurdles: New applicants must pass security examinations before they become recruits, and confidentiality rules are suspended for doctors who carry out medical examinations, so they can report tattoos that might indicate extremist views.

German military personnel are not only committed to defending the country and its constitution, or Basic Law, they also have a legal duty to actively defend democratic rights — that means, for example, voicing opposition when someone expresses extremist views. German soldiers, in other words, are supposed to be ""citizens in uniform,"" fully responsible for upholding the Basic Law. Holding certain opinions, such as Holocaust denial, are banned in the armed forces.

Despite these safeguards, Hoffstadt does not believe that the Bundeswehr is doing enough to keep extremist attitudes out of the military, especially in the context of a wider society where right-wing attitudes have become increasingly normalized — as shown by the success of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).

""There have been too many 'isolated cases' in the military to trust in the power of this gatekeeping,"" she said. ""They have a lot of seminars and meetings and political education, but in the bases, there is not a very close awareness of the complexity of the modern right-wing mindset.""

Steinbrecher is less pessimistic, arguing that the German military has stronger anti-extremism measures in place than most. ""I do think that it has become a priority,"" he said. ""I'm also involved in an international research project, with NATO countries, and I do have to say objectively that Germany really leads the way when it comes to extremism prevention.""

Nevertheless, Steinbrecher did warn that, with the German government now determined to ramp up recruitment, and perhaps even reintroduce some sort of military service, it might be much more difficult to carry out checks with the same degree of rigor.

""We can't put our hands in our laps,"" said Hoffstadt. ""We could say, 'oh, less than one percent, phew, everything is fine.' But it could be the tip of the iceberg. We have to continue to ask about the whole iceberg.""

DW,How Malcolm X fought against the 'American nightmare',"""By any means necessary"": He saw violence as a tool of resistance against the oppression of Black people. Malcolm X, who was born 100 years ago, remains an icon of the Black civil rights movement.

""What do you think you would do after 400 years of slavery and Jim Crow and lynching? Do you think you would respond nonviolently?"" Those were some of the key questions Malcolm X posed to American society.

Although slavery had been abolished in the US in 1865, the so-called Jim Crow laws continued to cement everyday discrimination against Black people until 1964. There were artificial barriers to their right to vote in some states, and in many they weren't allowed to sit next to white people on buses or in restaurants.

""Malcolm X addressed precisely the issues that were burning on the minds of oppressed African Americans,"" Britta Waldschmidt-Nelson, author of the biography ""Malcolm X: The Black Revolutionary,"" told DW.

His message to African Americans was clear: Be self-confident! Fight for your rights ""by any means necessary"" — even with violence.

Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Les Payne (1941-2018) recalled in his Malcolm X biography how a 1963 speech by the activist freed him, as if by a ""flashing sword blow,"" from the ""conditioned feeling of inferiority as a Black man"" deeply rooted in his psyche.

That was precisely Malcom X's goal.

Born on May 19, 1925, in Omaha, Nebraska, Malcolm Little's childhood near Detroit was marked by poverty and violence. He was six years old when his father was found dead; according to various accounts, he had been murdered by white supremacists. With seven children and little money, Malcom's mother was completely overwhelmed and became mentally ill. Malcolm was placed in various foster families and institutions; he later spoke in his autobiography of the ""terror of the very white social workers.""

Despite his difficult beginnings, he was a good student, the only Black person in his class. A key experience had a profound impact on him: His favorite teacher asked him what he wanted to be when he grew up. Malcolm replied that he would like to study law. But the teacher, using an offensive racist slur to describe him, told him that wasn't a realistic goal for a boy like him.

The young Malcolm was completely disillusioned. His grades dropped dramatically, and at 15, he moved to Boston to live with his half-sister Ella Collins, and later to New York. He supported himself by doing odd jobs before becoming a petty criminal. In his early 20s, he was imprisoned for various burglaries.

""Here is a Black man caged behind bars, probably for years, put there by the white man,"" he later wrote in his autobiography. ""You let this caged-up Black man start realizing, as I did, how from the first landing of this first slave ship, the millions of Black men in America have been like sheep in a den of wolves. That's why Black prisoners become Muslims so fast when Elijah Muhammad's teachings filter into their cages by the way of other Muslim convicts.""

The mentor Malcolm X refers to, Elijah Muhammad, was a Black separatist and the leader of the Nation of Islam, a religious-political organization of African Americans outside of Islamic orthodoxy.

Nation of Islam (NOI) ""claims that all Black people are inherently children of God and good, and all white people are inherently evil and children of the devil,"" explains Waldschmidt-Nelson. ""What made this very attractive to Malcolm and many other prison inmates, of course, is that someone would come along and say, 'You are not to blame for your misery; it is the blue-eyed devils who made you go astray.'""

After joining NOI, he started calling himself Malcolm X, because African Americans' surnames had historically been assigned by their slave owners. Therefore, NOI members rejected their slave names and called themselves simply ""X.""

He spent his seven years in prison educating himself and remained a member of NOI for 14 years. Leader Elijah Muhammed appreciated the young man's intellectual acumen and oratory skills and made him the organization's spokesperson.

In his speeches, Malcolm X repeatedly denounced the ""white devils."" Although he lived in the northern states of the US — the ""Promised Land"" for Black people from the even more restrictive southern states — he no longer placed any hope in white ""liberals"" there either. After all, he had personally experienced how Black people were treated as second-class citizens throughout the US.

Malcolm X was long scornful of Martin Luther King Jr.'s civil rights movement. He criticized King's famous speech at the 1963 March on Washington about a free and united America, united across all racial barriers, as unrealistic: ""No, I'm not an American. I'm one of 22 million Black people who are the victims of Americanism. [...] And I see America through the eyes of the victim. I don't see any American dream; I see an American nightmare.""

After becoming disillusioned with the organization's leader, Malcolm X broke ranks with the Nation of Islam in March 1964.

That same year, he made a pilgrimage to Mecca — and his image of the ""white devils"" began to waver. ""He was deeply impressed by the hospitality and warmth with which he was greeted, even by white Muslims in Saudi Arabia,"" writes Britta Waldschmidt-Nelson in her biography. ""And then, in the last year of his life, he turned away from this racist doctrine,"" she told DW.

He set himself a new task: ""Malcolm X wanted to create an alliance of all oppressed people of color against white colonial oppression,"" says the biographer.

On a trip to Africa, governments praised his intention, but he couldn't count on their support: ""Of course, they were all dependent on US development aid, and most African governments wouldn't have operated openly against the US at the time.""

Instead, Malcolm X became the focus of the CIA. The Nation of Islam was also on his heels. ""He knew he was going to be assassinated, and it was also a conscious decision on his part to face it,"" says Waldschmidt-Nelson. ""He probably said to himself: I can't give up now. After his experience in Mecca, Malcolm had embarked on a completely new path, open to collaborating with King's civil rights movement and, if necessary, with white people as well.""

But that never happened. On February 21, 1965, he was shot dead during a lecture by members of the Nation of Islam. He was only 39 years old.

In the 1980s, hip-hop artists celebrated Malcolm X's legacy by sampling his speeches in their music: ""All that became very resonant,"" says Michael E. Sawyer, professor of African American literature and culture at the University of Pittsburgh. ""It was a way to create this kind of resurgence of Black identity as also a political identity."" The songs served as political declarations of war on white racism, police brutality and the impoverishment of the Black underclass.

In 1992, Spike Lee adapted Malcolm X's autobiography into a film starring Denzel Washington, which also contributed to turning the revolutionary figure into an icon forging many Black people's cultural identity.

Today, as the current US administration is whitewashing history to understate the role racism played in shaping the country, and with the MAGA movement opposed to any criticism of America's alleged past glory, Malcolm X's words remain more relevant than ever:

""You're not to be so blind with patriotism that you can't face reality. Wrong is wrong, no matter who does it or says it.""

DW,"France's cognac producers weather climate change, tariffs","Cognac is considered by many to be the best brandy in the world. But those who make it are under pressure from Chinese and US duties, as well as global warming — all of which are forcing them to rethink their approach.

Vines for as far as the eye can see. Some 24 hectares (59 acres) belong to Alain Reboul, a 62-year-old, seventh-generation winemaker. His Earl du Bois Noble winery is one of the smaller ones in the Cognac region of France and is located around 100 kilometers (about 62 miles) north of the city of Bordeaux.

Wine production is strictly regulated in the region, which is the biggest white wine region in France and home to at least 4,350 winemakers. Only grapes from the six areas, or crus, of the Cognac geographical indication can be used to make the brandy that is produced in the region and bears the same name.

The largest market for cognac is the United States, whose President Donald Trump recently threatened to impose 200% tariffs on European spirits. The second-largest market is China, where President Xi Jinping already imposed temporary anti-dumping measures on imports of brandy in the fall of 2024 in retaliation to the European Union's approval of duties on electric vehicles made in China. The alcohol can no longer be sold in Chinese duty-free stores.

According to the French trade association, the Bureau National Interprofessionnel du Cognac (BNIC), exports to China have decreased by half, resulting in a loss of over €50 million (about $56 million) per month. The BNIC has appealed to the French government not to forget the approximately 70,000 jobs that depend directly and indirectly on cognac.

Along with a local winegrowers' union, the BNIC has recommended to winemakers that they get rid of some of their vines in order to save costs for machinery, fertilizers and pesticides. That's out of the question for Reboul, who has spent a large part of his career buying more land and planting more vines.

""You have to plant them for 30 years, at least,"" said the tall, weather-beaten man. ""For generations!""

Shorter-term thinking has not paid off for his family in the past, Reboul said, adding that his father switched to red wine during the oil crisis and that it wasn't worth it.

Just a few years ago, he said, the motto was ""Plant, plant, plant!"" The thirst for cognac seemed unquenchable. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine, almost 213 million bottles were sold in 2022, a record year, according to the BNIC.

Reboul said the current slump has been the greatest shock since the oil crisis. He has colleagues who have uprooted several hectares of vines, replacing them with olive trees or truffle plantations, but he said he will not do the same.

""My philosophy won't change,"" he said, adding that there have always been crises.

Apart from Chinese and US duties, the Cognac region has also been affected by the loss of the important Russian market in the wake of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Climate change is also putting a strain on winemakers because grapes are becoming sweeter; for good cognac, they need a certain acidity. The grapes are also ripening earlier, increasing the risk of a harvest failure because of hail, frost or disease.

Reboul sells his entire yield to Hennessy, one of the oldest and best-known cognac producers. He manages his estate with the help of relatives and seasonal workers, and said he loves his job.

Cassandre Allary runs her family business, the Tonnellerie Allary, with her brother. They have 26 employees and produce oak barrels and casks of all sizes for both wine and spirits. There are some 50 barrelmakers located between the cities of Cognac and Bordeaux, and their craft is recognized as part of the country's winemaking traditions.

It takes a lot of knowledge and craft to make a barrel, Allary said. The wood, which is always oak, is first dried outdoors for many months so that the wind and rain bring out the tannins. Then the barrels are toasted and fitted with heads and hoops before being polished and deburred, or smoothed out.

""The temperature [for toasting the wood] depends on the aromas that we want to tease out of the wood,"" she said. ""We do this according to the client's wishes.""

Allary explained that if the wood is toasted at low heat, it releases coconut aromas, whereas a medium heat reveals notes of vanilla, mocha or cocoa.

Regarding the current business climate, she said the small company, which used to supply only cognac distillers but diversified its portfolio in the 1990s, is running at full capacity this year, but orders are dwindling.

Almost all the 20,000 inhabitants in Cognac produce or market wine, cognac, barrels, glasses, bottles or labels. The brandy has enriched the region and particularly the town, which gives it its name.

Cognac owes its global success largely to trade. The fact that it is distilled made it possible to export it to other countries. Several famous cognac houses, many of which now belong to larger corporations, were founded by immigrants, including Bache-Gabrielsen, Hennessy and Martell. The the latter two, along with Courvoisier and Remy Martin, dominate about 90% of the market.

A gallery of portraits hangs above drawers full of historic bottle labels in the lobby of the Maison Bache-Gabrielsen, which was founded in 1905 and is still owned by the family. The company produces around 1 million bottles a year, which is not much compared to more famous brands, but a lot considering there are only 23 employees.

The wine is supplied by winegrowers like Reboul and is then turned into a high-proof ""eau de vie"" through double distillation. The brandy must then mature for at least two years in oak barrels so that it can absorb aromas from the wood. The different wines are then blended to produce the amber-colored end product.

Jean-Philippe Bergier is the cellar master, blender and ""nose"" of Bache-Gabrielsen. He has worked there for 35 years, blending up to 15 distillates from all of the region's areas. He said certain grape varieties, which bring more acidity and once were only added in small proportions to a blend, are now in demand because of climate change.

He said he has seen a number of trends come and go. Recently, Bache-Gabrielsen bottled a small batch of organic cognac in recycled bottles to test a new market segment. The company also wants to tap into new markets by producing cocktails, liqueurs and aperitifs.

He said there is a lot of interest from young people about how cognac is made. Though they drink less alcohol than older generations, they are more interested in quality. And that's why he believes firmly in the future of cognac.

DW,Can we learn to live with wildfires?,"Wildfires in Europe are becoming more severe. With climate change intensifying droughts and reducing summer rain, wildfire risk is predicted to more than double by 2100. Do we have to learn to live with fires?

In a single week in the fall of 2024, ravaging fires burnt down more than 100,000 hectares of land in Portugal — an area roughly the size of Hong Kong. Plumes of smoke were visible from space. It was one of the largest wildfires in Europe that year, killing at least seven people.

Fires on that scale are likely to happen more often, scientists say.

""Many parts of Europe are facing a large increase in multi-year droughts, leading to an increased probability of extreme fires,"" said Thomas Elmqvist, Environment Director of the European Academies Science Advisory Council (EASAC). ""Some areas are likely to experience severe events every two years.""

About 60,000 forest fires rage through the EU every year, causing €2 billion ($2.2 billion) in economic losses, the scientists laid out in a report published today. On average, they scorch an area nearly twice the size of Luxemburg — year by year.

Europe is the world's fastest warming continent. Over the past 30 years, temperatures have risen twice as much as the global average. Elmqvist points to the established link between climate change and elevated fire danger. Increasing droughts and less rain are expected to double the fire risk by 2100.

Increasing urbanization is another culprit for the flames. Abandoned farmland and unmanaged vegetation growth have created vast landscapes of flammable biomass, the scientists analyzed. Extensive monocultures, particularly of conifers, pines, and eucalyptus trees also ignite fast.

The highest risk in Germany, for example, is in the northeastern part of the country with its large pine plantations, said Elmqvist.

Having monitored wildfires over the course of two years, he concluded that the number of fires and total area burned have actually decreased in Europe, ""because we have more capacity to fight them.""

But the fires will become larger and more severe.

Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece are most affected, the scientists found.

Mediterranean countries are better prepared for fires compared to other European countries, says Claudia Berchtold from the Fraunhofer Gesellschaft. She is looking at research like the new EASAC study to formulate a strategy for Europe on how to deal with wildfires.

""In Germany or in the Netherlands for example, a comparatively small fire would meet a system that is not as well prepared,"" she added.

More than twice as many urban areas are deemed at risk of fire in Europe than in North America and Asia, the study found.

""Urbanizations have been built into pine plantations without thinking about what happens when big fires come,"" said ecologist Pierre Ibisch, who co-authored the study. ""This is of course very risky.""

This happened in the small town of Borkwalde in the German state of Brandenburg. Since 2000, people edged closer and closer into the forest, even after large fires led to evacuations in a nearby town, Ibisch said.

Problems like these could be avoided when landscape planners, foresters and farmers join forces, EASAC scientists say. They also call for more awareness and a public debate about the changing nature of fires.

""People living next to forests or moving into forests are not aware of the fact how much the fire is here and it's here to stay, and that we have the chance to reduce the risk by land management,"" Ibisch said.

The experts also say it's crucial to implement policies such as the EU's Nature Restoration law quicker and more consistently, most notably to manage forests sustainably and restore carbon-rich peatlands. Allowing feedstock to graze landscapes and even burn dry stretches under supervision can dramatically increase the intensity of the fire. ""Not all fires are bad"", Elmqvist said.

Low intensity fires can actually be part of a natural cycle and spur fresh regrowth.

Other solutions could be to map forests digitally, to allow for better monitoring. AI can also help in evaluating drone images of wildfires, or to monitor how quickly inflammable vegetation grows back after grazing.

DW,Why are environmental protesters being criminalized?,"Climate and environmental protest is rising in line with increasing global temperatures. But new draconian penalties are putting people who rally against climate pollution in jail.

In late 2024, in the industrial city of Newcastle on Australia's east coast, a flotilla of kayaks paddled into the harbor shipping lane to block a massive coal ship from docking.

The ""climate defenders"" gathered by activist group Rising Tide aimed to temporarily blockade the world's largest coal port and bring attention to a climate crisis caused primarily by burning fossil fuels. It also called for an end to new coal, oil and gas projects.

The New South Wales (NSW) state government and the police had attempted to stop the blockade in the courts. But after a judge lifted an order creating an exclusion zone at the port, the protesters held up the coal tanker for over 30 hours. Some 170 activists were arrested for alleged crimes, including the disruption of a major facility. Most could face fines of up to 22,000 Australian dollars (€12,350) or two years in jail, under a 2022 anti-protest bill.

The law criminalizes public assemblies that disrupt major public infrastructure such as roads, tunnels and ports, and was a response to past blockades by climate protesters. The then-NSW attorney general said that prior laws did not sufficiently penalize the ""major inconvenience that incidents like these cause to the community,"" along with ""severe financial impacts"" due to ""lost productivity.""

Zack Schofield, a spokesperson for Rising Tide who was also arrested, said the NSW law is being ""used to target climate protesters almost exclusively.""

A young climate activist who blockaded a lane on Sydney Harbour Bridge in 2022 was the first to be charged under the NSW law and was initially given a 15-month sentence.

Sue Higginson, a member for the Greens Party in NSW, called the imprisonment of the nonviolent protester ""undemocratic,"" adding that people should not be punished for ""engaging in legitimate forms of dissent and civil disobedience.""

One in five climate and environment protesters are arrested in Australia, which is the highest rate in the democratic world, according to a 2024 study on climate protest criminalization by researchers at the University of Bristol in the UK.

Harsh anti-protest laws have been passed across the country, the world's third-largest fossil fuel exporter. That includes the island state of Tasmania, where protests at sites of old growth forest logging can incur a $13,000 fine or a two-year prison sentence.

Similar punitive anti-protest laws have been enacted across Europe and US.

In the UK, recent amendments to the Public Order Act give police increased power to act on ""serious disruption"" from public protests.

Five Just Stop Oil activists were charged under the revised act for organizing the blockade of a UK motorway in 2022.

Charged with conspiracy to create a ""public nuisance,"" the protesters were sentenced to prison terms of between four and five years in 2024 before their sentences were slightly reduced.

Said to be the longest sentences for a nonviolent protest in British legal history, they were almost on par with the five-year maximum sentence for aggravated assault, noted Global Witness, UK-based campaigners monitoring the criminalization and killing of environmental defenders.

The UK law has been used against climate and environmental protest 95% of the time, said Oscar Berglund, a senior lecturer in international public and social policy at the University of Bristol, who co-authored the 2024 report ""Criminalisation and Repression of Climate and Environmental Protests.""

In Germany, members of the nonviolent climate action group Letzte Generation (Last Generation) were charged in May 2024 with ""forming a criminal organization,"" said Berglund.

The law is typically used against mafia organizations, and has never been applied to a nonviolent activist group, said the researcher.

Meanwhile, anti-terror laws and military action have been used to suppress climate actions, including a blockade of a highway in The Hague, Netherlands, in 2023. This was in contravention of statute law, according to an Amnesty International study that described a ""sweeping pattern of systematic attacks"" that ""undermine peaceful protest"" across 21 European countries.

In addition to anti-protest laws passed by governments, climate activists are facing massive compensation claims from fossil fuel companies for disruptions caused during actions.

Known as strategic lawsuits against public participation (SLAPP), the anti-protest litigation peaked in March 2025 when a jury in the US state of North Dakota found Greenpeace liable for more than $660 million (€609 million) for its role in an oil pipeline blockade.

The action was bought by oil major, Energy Transfer, which has faced years-long resistance to an oil pipeline running through North Dakota — especially from the local Sioux Tribe, who set up a protest at the Standing Rock Reservation that gained international attention.

""It's part of a renewed push by corporations to weaponize our courts to silence dissent,"" said Sushma Raman, interim executive director of Greenpeace USA, of the compensation that could force the organization to shut down its US operations.

Beyond the threat of arrest and litigation, some 2,000 environmental defenders were murdered between 2012 and 2023, with 401 cases reported in Brazil and 298 in the Philippines, according to the Bristol University report on the criminalization and suppression of climate and environmental protest.

""You don't have to dig very deep,"" said Berglund of the influence of oil, gas and coal interests on harsher anti-protest laws and policing. ""The protesters are being targeted because they are a threat to fossil fuel profits.""

He added that in the UK, anti-protest laws were drafted in consultation with a right-wing think tank, Policy Exchange, which has openly promoted the oil and gas lobby.

But for Luke McNamara, a professor at the Faculty of Law and Justice at the University of New South Wales, these ""punitive actions"" also reflect ""growing intolerance"" for the disruption caused by climate protesters resorting to peaceful civil disobedience.

""Australian politicians regularly share their great affection for the right to protest,"" he said in reference to new local anti-protest laws. However, this principle ""tends to crumble each time an innovative climate protest garners attention,"" he told DW.

Back in Newcastle, some 130 Rising Tide protesters who pleaded not guilty remain uncertain about the severity of potential fines or imprisonment when their trial begins later this month.

""If the penalties are disproportionate, we will appeal,"" said spokesperson Zack Schofield of what could become a test case for judicial willingness to criminalize environmental dissent in Australia — and beyond.

For Berglund, such prosecutions confirm the increasing impact of the climate movement. ""Protesters are targeted when they are successful,"" he said.

DW,Hungary's Orban plans 'transparency law' to muzzle critics,"The ruling Fidesz party, led by Prime Minister Viktor Orban, has proposed a law that could be used to ban political parties and media outlets.

""The bugs have overwintered,"" Viktor Orban said earlier this year, referring to journalists, political opponents and his critics. ""We will dismantle the financial machine that has used corrupt dollars to buy politicians, judges, journalists, pseudo-NGOs and political activists. We will eliminate the entire shadow army.""

For Hungary's populist prime minister, that time has now come. This week, Orban's Fidesz party presented a bill that, according to The Associated Press news agency, ""would allow the government to monitor, restrict, penalize and potentially ban organizations it deems a threat to national sovereignty.""

Reporting the news, Hungary's largest independent news portal Telex, which is usually rather cautious in its choice of words, wrote that Hungary had left Europe. Its report was accompanied by a graphic of a black boot sole emblazoned with the Fidesz logo, as well as that of the Russian domestic intelligence service, the FSB.

The draft law on ""transparency of public life,"" as it's known, was presented late Tuesday to the Hungarian parliament. Despite its rather innocuous title, if adopted it would create conditions akin to those in Russia regarding freedom of expression. For example, it would allow for the blacklisting of organizations, including media outlets, if they were deemed to ""threaten the sovereignty of Hungary by using foreign funding to influence public life.""

According to the bill, threats to national sovereignty comprise the violation of the values and provisions of the Hungarian constitution, as well as the negative portrayal of these or the support of any attempt to undermine them. The constitutional values are described as including the unity and cohesion of all Hungarians, Hungary's Christian culture, marriage as being understood exclusively as a union between a man and a woman, or the pursuit of peace and cooperation with other peoples and countries.

The bill describes organizations to be all legal entities, registered or not. Activities that ""influence public life"" can include those that ""try to influence any decision-making process or the will of voters.""

If the law is adopted, the Hungarian Sovereignty Protection Office, created in early 2024, will be given the power to classify all organizations as receiving ""foreign support,"" regardless of the amount and without a lower limit, if they receive any donations or gifts from abroad. That means a book would fall into this category, as would EU funding.

At the request of the body, the government would be able to list all organizations concerned in a special register. This would have such far-reaching consequences as not being able to qualify for the 1% income tax rule that stipulates that private individuals can donate 1% of their annual income tax to nonprofits.

If the law is passed, in future donors will have to include in writing that their contribution does not include any ""foreign donations."" Organizations listed in the register will not be able to receive foreign funds without state approval. If they do receive money, they will be penalized with heavy fines and might even be banned.

The draft law does not allow for any appeals to object to being listed in the register.

In summary: If the law is adopted, Orban will be able to use it to criminalize and ban anyone or anything that criticizes him and his regime, from websites to political parties.

Orban's government has already passed several laws aimed at discrediting critics in Hungary, such as the 2018 ""Stop Soros"" legislation, which criminalizes any individual or group that offers to help an illegal immigrant claim asylum. But this bill goes beyond that, a fact that the government hasn't been hiding.

""The government has made it clear that this is not just about oversight,"" wrote government spokesperson Zoltan Kovacs. ""It's about Hungary's right to self-determination in the face of coordinated international pressure.""

Kovacs said that foreign-funded NGOs and media outlets had previously spread propaganda regarding migration and gender-related issues, but were now spreading pro-war and pro-Ukrainian propaganda. ""The transparency law is the best tool against Ukrainian propaganda,"" he insisted.

Independent media outlets, civil organizations and opposition parties have been united in their scathing criticism of the draft law.

""The authorities want to control everything, they do not tolerate any place of free activity,"" wrote the Telex portal. ""Anything that is free, that is not under their influence, they close down, take away, making it impossible.""

The Hungarian Civil Liberties Union, one of Hungary's most important civil rights organizations, said in a statement: ""This is not about protecting sovereignty. The government is trembling at the loss of power.""

Peter Magyar, the leader of Hungary's largest opposition party, Tisza, said the bill was ""another step on the Putin path."" He added that Orban was adopting things from his teacher [Russian President] Vladimir Putin.

""The bill ... follows the Russian playbook,"" Budapest Mayor Gergely Karacsony wrote on Facebook, adding that Orban was ""trying in vain to turn our homeland into Russia, Budapest is not Moscow and never will be.""

If the law does come into force, the work of independent media outlets and NGOs will become extremely difficult, as many of them rely on the 1% tax rule for their activities. They could also be banned for the slightest infringement.

But it's the Tisza Party, which is currently well ahead of Fidesz in the polls, that could really bear the brunt of the law, ahead of next spring's parliamentary elections.

Orban has long claimed that the European Union and Ukraine have colluded with the Tisza Party to bring about a change of power in Hungary. This week, he went a step further and posted a video to Facebook in which he said that a Hungarian opposition party had played an active role in an operation carried out by the Ukrainian secret services. He accused Magyar and his party of launching ""an attack against the Hungarian Armed Forces."" There is no evidence for this claim.

The ""transparency"" law will be debated over the coming week, and it's not yet known when a vote will take place. What is certain is that the European Court of Justicewill most certainly declare the law illegal if adopted, but that could take years. By then, Orban might have achieved his goal of maintaining power at all costs.

DW,Swedish journalist jailed for insulting Erdogan freed,"Joakim Medin was jailed last month for ""insulting"" Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The journalist was in Turkey, covering protests triggered by the arrest of the Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.

A Swedish journalist arrested in Turkey and jailed for ""insulting"" President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been set free, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said Friday.

""Swedish journalist Joakim Medin is on his way home from Turkey to Sweden,"" Kristersson posted on X, adding the 40-year-old would ""land in a few hours.""

""I would like to thank the staff at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs who, under the leadership of Minister for Foreign Affairs Maria Malmer Stenergard, have worked intensively on this issue. I would also like to thank my European colleagues who have been helpful in the process.""

Medin works for the Swedish newspaper Dagens ETC and was stopped upon his arrival in Istanbul on March 27.

The reporter traveled to Turkey to cover the protests sparked by the arrest on March 19 of the Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.

Imamoglu was resoundingly re-elected as Istanbul mayor for the third time last year. The center-left CHP party has now designated him as its candidate for the race despite his detention.

Nearly 1,900 people have been arrested in the protests. The Turkish government has also continued its crackdown on the press amid the demonstrations.

Medin was given an 11-month suspended sentence at an Ankara court for ""insulting the president,"" adding terrorism to the charges.

Despite the punishment being suspended, Medin had to stay behind bars while awaiting a different trial for ""belonging to a terror organization.""

Medin refuted the charges that he took part in a protest by the banned Kurdish Workers Party (PKK) in Stockholm in January 2023.

The PKK this month announced it would disband and end its armed insurgency against Turkey.

DW,NATO corruption probe 'reminder' of defense boom risks,"The military alliance's procurement agency is under scrutiny for deals on arms and munitions. In a sector with notoriously patchy oversight, defense boom corruption risks are very real.

Revelations of an unfolding corruption investigation involving staff and ex-staff at the NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA) have continued to emerge, with a total of five detentions — two in Belgium and three in the Netherlands — made public so far.

The Belgian public prosecutor reported the first detentions late Wednesday, saying they concerned ""possible irregularities"" in contracts awarded to buy ammunition and drones via NATO.

The Belgian authorities said in a statement that NSPA employees or former employees in Luxembourg may have passed information to defense contractors. ""There are indications that money obtained from these illegal practices would have been laundered, partly by setting up consultancy companies.""

A short time later, Dutch authorities announced that they had made three arrests, including of one 58-year-old former Defense Ministry official whose previous job had ""involved international procurement contracts.""

In Luxembourg, the public prosecutor's office confirmed that documents had been seized in the Grand Duchy and said that the investigation had also spread into Italy, Spain and the US, coordinated by the EU justice agency Eurojust.

At the recent NATO meeting in Antalya, Turkey, the military alliance's secretary-general, Mark Rutte, told reporters that it was the agency itself that initiated investigations. ""We want to get to the root of this,"" Rutte said.

With a staff of more than 1,500 people, the NSPA is headquartered in Luxembourg and has sites in several other European countries. As well as providing logistics support for NATO operations or missions, it can also negotiate defense contracts on behalf of the member states.

Such joint procurement initiatives are supposed to save national governments money by efficiently bundling demand. According to NATO, the agency itself operates on a ""no-loss, no-profit"" basis.

Last year, the NSPA signed a nearly $700-million (€624 million) contract for Stinger anti-aircraft missiles on behalf of several member states. Former NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg announced the deal in May 2024, without naming the countries involved, in comments reported by the Reuters news agency.

For defense expert Francesca Grandi of watchdog Transparency International, the ongoing NATO probe, whatever its outcome, is a ""precious reminder"" of the importance of thorough oversight of how public money is spent on defense. ""This case really is timely, in a way, because it reminds us of the importance of transparency.""

For NATO, the timing is somewhat unfortunate. Eyeballing Russia's massive military buildup amid its ongoing war with Ukraine, NATO countries are in the midst of a huge defense spending boom likely to last years.

At an upcoming NATO summit, under pressure from US President Donald Trump, the 32 countries look set to commit to spend at least 3.5% of their gross domestic product.

This would be a huge step up from the current target of 2%, as well as the current average proportional GDP expenditure of 2.7%. In 2024, the alliance collectively spent $1.3 trillion on defense, according to NATO figures published last month.

Meanwhile, the European Union, whose members make up two-thirds of NATO, is teeing up for a major spending spree. The European Commission has announced a plan to use the EU's excellent credit rating to borrow €150 billion ($168 billion) that could help the 27 EU members invest €800 billion more in defense.

With additional hundreds of billions set to flow to the defense industry in the next five years, public institutions will likely come under enormous pressure to manage risks of potential corruption.

Worldwide, the defense sector is particularly prone to corruption due to the high levels of secrecy that shroud governments contracts, the large amounts of money at stake and the sensitive nature of negotiations, Grandi explained.

Europe is no exception. At national and EU level, many of the transparency mechanisms that are supposed to help root out other public procurement processes often do not apply to defense and security.

For example, the European Parliament does not have its normal budgetary oversight over money sent to Ukraine for its defense needs through the European Peace Facility. More than €10 billion has already been allocated to Kyiv through the mechanism, which is outside the EU budget.

In general, Transparency International is very concerned about the lack of policymaker attention to transparency and oversight it sees in the burgeoning defense spending wave, Grandi said. At the same time, defense industry lobbying is on the rise.

""The risk from a lack of oversight is that we end up with a defense architecture that is not ensuring the security of its citizens as it should do, that is marred in inefficiencies, that wastes money, but also that creates space for abuse of power, for undue influence,"" she warned.

DW,From AfD to Reform UK: The far right and European politics,"The nationalist Alternative for Germany is shunned by other parties domestically. But elsewhere in Europe far-right parties are on the rise and some have made it into in government.

At the beginning of May, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution(BfV), Germany's domestic intelligence agency, classified the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) as a ""confirmed right-wing-extremist"" party. The AfD is now challenging this decision in court. The BfV has announced that it will not use the extremism label until the court rules on the matter. The classification as right-wing-extremist has reignited debate in Germany about whether the AfD should be banned.

No other country in Europe is considering such a ban to contain the ascendant far right. In some countries, in fact, similar parties are part of the government or, in some cases, even lead it.

DW looks at where far-right parties stand in several European countries.

Chancellor Christian Stocker, of the conservative Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) does not consider Herbert Kickl's Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) right-wing-extremist. Austria's other political parties have not committed themselves to avoid cooperation with the FPÖ. The ÖVP has formed coalition governments with the FPÖ twice already, the first time back in 2000. This was seen as a scandal in the European Union at the time, and, for a few months, other EU member states kept their relations with the Austrian government to a minimum.

The FPÖ is relatively young in the history of Austria's parliament. The party was founded in 1955 by a former Nazi functionary and later softened its views.

Like the AfD, the FPÖ is critical of immigration, globalization and the European Union. However, the FPÖ appears more willing to compromise and appears less ideological, perhaps due to the number of times it has been part of government, including at the national level.

Last year, it won the parliamentary elections for the first time, garnering 28.8% of the vote. Nevertheless, it was unable to form a coalition government. In the meantime, however, it is even stronger in the polls than it was during the election.

The National Rally has come a long way since it was founded in 1972 by Jean-Marie Le Pen under the name Front National. When his daughter Marine Le Pen took the helm, she renamed the party and moved it — somewhat — towards the center.

Although the party is still critical of immigration and Islam, it is no longer openly antisemitic. This approach helped it attract a new group of voters. Le Pen has run for president three times, most recently losing in the runoff, while still managing to secure more votes each time.

Following a court ruling for misappropriation of public funds, Marine Le Pen was recently barred from running in elections for five years. Current polls show that if either she or the party leader, Jordan Bardella, were to run again, they would have a good chance of at least making it past the first round. In the 2024 parliamentary elections, the RN was the strongest party.

The RN's penchant for protectionism and statism — in other words: the belief that the state can solve major problems — stands in stark contrast to the AfD's viewpoints. In any case, Le Pen has distanced herself from the AfD. The German party is allegedly too radical for her, but this could be a domestic political strategy to appear more respectable.

Giorgia Meloni stands at the helm of the Brothers of Italy party, making her probably Europe's most successful far-right head of state. Many in the Brothers of Italy have a positive view of fascism, the Italian version of National Socialism. Giorgia Meloni once said that she had ""an untroubled relationship with fascism"" and that the former fascist head of government and Hitler ally Benito Mussolini was ""a good politician.""

In the 2022 election campaign, which brought her party to power, her slogan was ""God, Family and Fatherland.""

Meloni and her party campaign against abortions,  LGTBQ+ people and, of course against migrants.

In contrast to many similar politicians in Europe, Meloni has taken a clear stance against Russia in the Ukraine war. This is the main reason why she spoke of ""irreconcilable differences"" with the AfD. At the same time, Meloni has a close relationship with US President Donald Trump and is therefore valued in Brussels as a transatlantic mediator.

The roots of the Sweden Democrats lie in the right-wing-extremist movement Bevara Sverige Svenskt (Sweden should remain Swedish). Shortly before the turn of the millennium, the party tried to distance itself from its roots and adopted a more moderate stance.

The current party leader, Jimmie Akesson, is continuing this strategy and was successful in making the Sweden Democrats the second-strongest party in the 2022 parliamentary elections. Since then, the party has backed the minority government of conservative Prime Minister Ulf Hjalmar Kristersson.

As with far-right parties in other countries, the most important issue for the Sweden Democrats is immigration. Widespread gang crime in Sweden's major cities has been instrumental in the Sweden Democrats' electoral success. While unusual for a party on the far right, the party has declared its support for climate protection.

Since the 2023 parliamentary elections, Geert Wilders' Party for Freedom has been the strongest party in the Netherlands and leads a coalition government together with three other parties. Because Wilders was too radical for the coalition partners, Dick Schoof, who has no party affiliation, became prime minister. The PVV is unique in that Wilders is the only party member; even MPs and ministers are officially only supporters of the party. This means that Wilders can also determine the party program alone and nominate candidates for elections himself.

The PVV's priority is fighting irregular immigration and, above all, Islam. With his aim of banning the Koran and all new mosque buildings, Wilders takes the issue a step further than most. Before the recent election, however, Wilders said that he would put his views on Islam ""in the freezer"" in order to be able to govern. In addition, he campaigns against climate protection and the EU, which he sees as intrusive.

Reform UK has undergone several transformations: After breaking away from the UK Independence Party, whose main objective was withdrawing the UK from the EU, it became the Brexit Party. Once Brexit was achieved, the party renamed the Reform UK Party. At each step, the leading figure was Nigel Farage, the spectre of established British politics.

In the meantime, the party has taken up the cause of drastically reducing the number of immigrants — and using this to pressure the ruling Labour Party as well as the Conservatives. Farage has been successful at accusing both parties of inaction.

Just days after Reform UK performed well in regional elections, Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer promised to drastically reduce both unauthorized migration and migration for work. According to the latest national polls, Reform UK is just ahead of Labor and the Conservatives. Deputy party leader Richard Tice calls the official British goal of climate neutrality ""absurd.""

DW,Rights under constant attack in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan,"A UN report has found that the rights of religious and ethnic minorities, as well as all women, are under constant attack by the Taliban authorities.

Amid many other global crises, the human rights situation in Afghanistan has been overshadowed in the international media. Millions of people continue to suffer from systemic rights violations under the Taliban-run government, a UN report has found.

Tasked with assisting the people of Afghanistan, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) monitors the human rights situation in the country, issuing regular reports. In its latest update on the human rights situation in Afghanistan, UNAMA not only documented cases of gender-based violence and public floggings but also the growing persecution of the Ismaili community.

Ismailism is a branch of Shia Islam, while Sunni Islam is the dominant religion in Afghanistan. Most members of the Ismaili community live in the country's northern provinces, such as Badakhshan or Baghlan. In the former, there have been at least 50 cases of members of the Ismaili community being forced to convert to the Sunni faith. Those who refused to do so were subjected to physical assaults, coercion and death threats.

""They are only accepted as Muslims if they profess the Sunni faith by force,"" Yaqub Yasna, a professor and member of the Afghan Ismaili community, told DW. Yasna himself was accused of blasphemy after the Taliban takeover of 2021 because he advocated enlightenment and tolerance in society. He was forced to step down from his position at his university and went into exile for fear of reprisals.

Yasna said that even before the Taliban's return to power, tolerance toward the Ismaili minority in Afghanistan was limited but that the political system had at least protected their civil rights.

He said that under the Taliban, tolerance had continued to decline steadily. ""When their rights are violated today, they don't know who they can turn to. Their children are forced to profess the Sunni faith,"" he explained. ""Under Taliban rule, only one faith is considered legitimate. Anything that deviates from their interpretation of Islam is rejected and thus creates a breeding ground for violence against religious minorities.""

Afghan human rights activist Abdullah Ahmadi confirmed there was increasing pressure on one of the last remaining religious minorities in Afghanistan. ""We have received several reports showing that children from the Ismaili community are being forced to attend Sunni-run religious schools. If they refuse to do so, or do not attend classes regularly, their families have to pay heavy fines,"" he said.

Ahmadi complained that the international community had responded only hesitantly to the human rights violations in his country. He called for targeted sanctions against Taliban officials, saying they ""must be held accountable.""

Historically, the country was a significant center of religious diversity, but there are very few members of non-Muslim communities left in Afghanistan today.

The last members of the Jewish community left the country in September 2021. Those Christians who still live there tend to practice their faith in secret. And the Hazaras, another ethnic minority in Afghanistan who are predominantly Shiite, continue to be persecuted.

The Taliban only accept one interpretation of religion and have banned certain rituals and festivals, including Nowruz, which marks the beginning of spring and a new year. They declared the holiday ""un-Islamic"" and said that nobody in Afghanistan should observe the celebration.

The situation of all women is also getting worse, which means that half of society is subject to systematic oppression. According to the UNAMA report, girls continue to be ""barred from participating in education beyond grade six"" and there has been ""no announcement made by the de facto authorities regarding the reopening of high schools and universities to girls and women.""

In the western city of Herat, the Taliban has confiscated several rickshaws and warned drivers not to transport women who were unaccompanied by a ""mahram,"" a close male relative.

Despite this disastrous situation, Afghans who fled to neighboring countries are being expelled en masse. According to the United Nations, around 110,000 people, including women and children, were forced to return from Pakistan in April. Large numbers of people are also being deported from Iran.

""We live in fear of being deported to Afghanistan every day,"" Afghan journalist Marzia Rahimi told DW. ""What am I supposed to do with my children there?""

Rahimi said that only misery and terror awaited her in Afghanistan if she returned, explaining that she had left because she was unable to continue working as a journalist under Taliban rule and would not have been able to provide her daughter with an education.

Most independent media outlets have been banned or placed under the control of the state. Journalists who criticize the regime risk being arrested and tortured.

Under the Taliban, the country has also been plunged into an even more catastrophic socioeconomic crisis. Some 64% of the population of 41.5 million lives in poverty, according to the UN, with 50% dependent on humanitarian aid for survival and 14% suffering from acute hunger.

DW,Germany eyes strongest EU army by 2031,"German Chancellor Friedrich Merz plans to make the Bundeswehr the ""strongest conventional army in Europe."" Other EU countries also have ambitious plans for their armed forces. DW takes a closer look.

US President Donald Trump can feel vindicated: Germany's new foreign minister, Johann Wadephul, said this week that the government had accepted the president's demand to invest 5% of GDP in defense. Speaking at a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Antalya, Turkey, on Thursday, Wadephul also said Germany would support NATO's proposal to provide 3.5% for classic military purposes and an additional 1.5% for defense-related infrastructure.

It will likely only become clear how much all the members of the security alliance plan to invest at a NATO summit scheduled for the end of June in The Hague, Netherlands.

Wadephul's comments came a day after German Chancellor Friedrich Merz announced that he wanted to transform the Bundeswehr into the ""strongest conventional army in Europe.""

If Germany goes ahead and increases its defense expenditure to 5% of GDP, it will be making a historic turnaround in security policy. Since the end of the Cold War, it has primarily relied on international cooperation, diplomacy and a culture of strategic military restraint. But former Chancellor Olaf Scholz's Zeitenwende speech on February 27, 2022, three days after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, marked a turning point.

Subsequently, the German government set up a special fund of €100 billion (about $112 billion) for the Bundeswehr. In 2024, regular defense spending amounted to around €90 billion, around 2.1% of GDP. An increase to 5% will require a future defense budget of over €160 billion per year. This will have enormous implications that have not yet been fully calculated, and for which the funds have yet to be raised.

The Bundeswehr currently consists of around 182,000 soldiers on active duty. The Defense Ministry plans to raise those numbers to at least 203,000 by 2031, with some experts even speaking of 240,000 soldiers. Ongoing modernization efforts will affect all branches of the armed forces: the aim is to replace outdated tanks, aircraft and ships, to develop digitalization and expand command and control capabilities.

The key industrial players in Germany are Rheinmetall, Airbus Defence and Space and the Diehl Group, which are becoming increasingly geared toward exports alongside foreign partners.

France, which is the only nuclear power in the EU, has pursued a strategy of global presence and military autonomy. Around 203,000 soldiers serve in the French army. The gendarmerie and other paramilitary units boast 175,000 members, and there are also at least 26,000 reservists.

Thanks to its Charles de Gaulle nuclear-powered aircraft carrier and strategic submarines, the French navy also plays an important role in France's nuclear deterrence strategy. French Rafale fighter aircraft, some of which are nuclear-capable, are intended to secure air superiority.

Since President Emmanuel Macron came to power in 2017, the French defense budget has increased significantly. In a dramatic televised speech at the beginning of March, Macron spoke of the ""Russian threat"" affecting all countries in Europe and said France should nearly double its defense spending.

France's military budget used to be comparable to Germany's, but it has helped to build a more powerful army, not least because the state, which has a stake in the arms industry, has always promoted it strategically.

For years, Poland has invested heavily in the military with the goal of developing the strongest land forces in Europe. In 2024, it allocated 4.12% of its GDP to its defense budget. The largest state on NATO's eastern flank specifically wants to deter Russia.

The Polish Land Forces and Territorial Defense Army currently comprise about 150,000 soldiers. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk recently said the government is working on plans for the country to expand the ranks to 500,000 troops, including reservists.

At the same time, the army and air force are to be supplied with more modern equipment, including more than 600 battle tanks, which have been ordered from South Korea and the US among others, as well as HIMARS rocket artillery systems, drones and F-35 fighter jets.

The Polish navy, however, is considered to be rather weak.

The UK is also planning to increase its defense spending, to just under 2.4% of GDP. The focus will be on high tech: drones, artificial intelligence and laser systems. The Royal Navy, which has two aircraft carriers in service, and the Royal Air Force are already considered to be very modern. The government has planned to purchase dozens more F-35 fighter jets from the US.

With around 140,000 active soldiers, the British Army is comparatively small. No significant increases in personnel are currently planned, in contrast to many EU countries.

Last year, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer emphasized the UK's loyalty to NATO and said the country would play a ""full role"" in the alliance.

The UK's military equipment, particularly the nuclear weapons stored on submarines, is more dependent on US technology than that of many EU countries.

According to NATO, Italy allocated 1.49% to its defense budget in 2024, which means it is still well below the 2% target. Nonetheless, the country is one of Europe's heavyweights, with 165,000 soldiers on active duty, two aircraft carriers and a powerful air force.

However, Italy's land forces are considered to be outdated and in need of reform. But this is set to change, with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni saying she wants her country to have the strongest armored force in Europe. Italy has ordered more 1,000 combat and multi-purpose tanks from the German company Rheinmetall.

In strategic terms, Italy is largely focused on the Mediterranean region and securing global trade routes.

Despite these multibillion euro rearmament programs in Europe, little is likely to change in the global ranking of military strength, at least in the medium term.

According to the 2025 Global Firepower review, the United States clearly leads and is followed by Russia, China, India and South Korea. The UK follows in sixth place, while France is ninth. Germany is currently 11th.

For its annual review, the Global Firepower platform evaluates over 60 individual factors, from numbers of tanks and naval capacities to manpower, in order to compare the military strength of nations.

DW,Fact check: How trustworthy are AI fact checks?,"The use of AI chatbots for fact-checking is on the rise. However, Grok's unsolicited claims about ""white genocide"" show that the responses of Grok, ChatGPT, Meta AI and other chatbots are not always reliable.

""Hey, @Grok, is this true?"" Ever since Elon Musk's xAI launched its generative artificial intelligence chatbot Grok in November 2023, and especially since it was rolled out to all non-premium users in December 2024, thousands of X (formerly Twitter) users have been asking this question to carry out rapid fact checks on information they see on the platform.

A recent survey carried out by a British online technology publication TechRadar found that 27% of Americans had used artificial intelligence tools such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Meta's Meta AI, Google's Gemini, Microsoft's Copilot or apps like Perplexity instead of traditional search engines like Google or Yahoo.

But how accurate and reliable are the chatbots' responses? Many people have asked themselves this question in the face of Grok's recent statements about ""white genocide"" in South Africa. Apart from Grok's problematic stance on the topic, X users were also irritated about the fact that the bot started to talk about the issue when it was asked about completely different topics, like in the following example:

The discussion around the alleged ""white genocide"" arose after the Trump administration brought white South Africans to the United States as refugees. Trump said they were facing a ""genocide"" in their homeland — an allegation that lacks any proof and that many see as related to the racist conspiracy myth of the ""Great Replacement"".

xAI blamed an ""unauthorized modification"" for Grok's obsession with the ""white genocide"" topic, and said it had ""conducted a thorough investigation."" But do flaws like this happen regularly? How sure can users be to get reliable information when they want to fact-check something with AI?

We analyzed this and answered these questions for you in this DW Fact Check.

Two studies conducted this year by the British public broadcaster BBC and the Tow Center for Digital Journalism in the United States found significant shortcomings when it comes to the ability of generative AI chatbots to accurately convey news reporting.

In February, the BBC study found that ""answers produced by the AI assistants contained significant inaccuracies and distorted content"" produced by the organization.

When it asked ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini and Perplexity to respond to questions about current news by using BBC articles as sources, it found that 51% of the chatbots' answers had ""significant issues of some form.""

Nineteen percent of answers were found to have added their own factual errors, while 13% of quotes were either altered or not present at all in cited articles.

""AI assistants cannot currently be relied upon to provide accurate news and they risk misleading the audience,"" said Pete Archer, director of the BBC's Generative AI Program.

Similarly, research by the Tow Center for Digital Journalism, published in the Columbia Journalism Review (CJR) in March, found that eight generative AI search tools were unable to correctly identify the provenance of article excerpts in 60% of cases.

Perplexity performed best with a failure rate of ""only"" 37%, while Grok answered 94% of queries incorrectly.

The CJR said it was particularly concerned by the ""alarming confidence"" with which AI tools presented incorrect answers. ""ChatGPT, for instance, incorrectly identified 134 articles, but signaled a lack of confidence just fifteen times out of its two hundred [total] responses, and never declined to provide an answer,"" said the report.

Overall, the study found that chatbots were ""generally bad at declining to answer questions they couldn't answer accurately, offering incorrect or speculative answers instead"" and that AI search tools ""fabricated links and cited syndicated and copied versions of articles.""

And where does AI itself get its information from? It's fed by different sources like extensive databases and web searches. Depending on how AI chatbots are trained and programmed, the quality and accuracy of their answers can vary.



""One issue that recently emerged is the pollution of LLMs [Large Language Models — Editor's note] by Russian disinformation and propaganda. So clearly there is an issue with the 'diet' of LLMs,"" Tommaso Canetta told DW. He's the deputy director of the Italian fact-checking project Pagella Politica and fact checking coordinator at the European Digital Media Observatory.

""If the sources are not trustworthy and qualitative, the answers will most likely be of the same kind,"" Canetta explained. He said that he regularly comes across responses which are ""incomplete, not precise, misleading or even false.""

In the case of xAI and Grok, whose owner, Elon Musk, is a fierce supporter of US President Donald Trump, there is a clear danger that the ""diet"" could be politically controlled, he added.

In April 2024, Meta AI reportedly posted in a New York parenting group on Facebook that it had a disabled yet academically gifted child and offered advice on special schooling.

Eventually, the chatbot apologized and admitted that it didn't have ""personal experiences or children,"" as Meta told 404media, which reported on the incident:

""This is new technology and it may not always return the response we intend, which is the same for all generative AI systems. Since we launched, we've constantly released updates and improvements to our models and we're continuing to work on making them better,"" a spokesperson said in a statement.

In the same month, Grok misinterpreted a viral joke about a poorly-performing basketball player and told users in its trending section that he was under investigation by police after being accused of vandalizing homes with bricks in Sacramento, California.

Grok had misunderstood the common basketball expression whereby a player who has failed to get any of their throws on target is said to have been ""throwing bricks.""

Other mistakes have been less amusing. In August 2024, Grok spread misinformation regarding the deadline for US presidential nominees to be added to ballots in nine federal states following the withdrawal of former President Joe Biden from the race.

In a public letter to Musk, the secretary of state for Minnesota, Steve Simon, wrote that, within hours of Biden's announcement, Grok had generated false headlines that Vice President Kamala Harris would be ineligible to appear on the ballot in multiple states — untrue information.

It's not just news that AI chatbots appear to have difficulties with; they also exhibit severe limitations when it comes to identifying AI-generated images.

In a quick experiment, DW asked Grok to identify the date, location and origin of an AI-generated image of a fire at a destroyed aircraft hangar taken from a TikTok video. In its response and explanations, Grok claimed that the image showed several different incidents at several different locations, ranging from a small airfield in Salisbury in England, to Denver International Airport in Colorado, to Tan Son Nhat International Airport in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.

There have indeed been accidents and fires at these locations in recent years, but the image in question showed none of them. DW strongly believes it was generated by artificial intelligence, which Grok seemed unable to recognize, despite clear errors and inconsistencies in the image — including inverted tail fins on airplanes and illogical jets of water from fire hoses.

Even more concerningly, Grok recognized part of the ""TikTok"" watermark visible in the corner of the image and suggested that this ""supported its authenticity."" Conversely, under its ""More details"" tab, Grok stated TikTok was ""a platform often used for rapid dissemination of viral content, which can lead to misinformation if not properly verified.""

Similarly, just this week, Grok informed X users (in Portuguese) that a viral video purporting to show a huge anaconda in the Amazon, seemingly measuring several hundred meters (over 500 feet) in length, was real — despite it clearly having been generated by artificial intelligence, and Grok even recognizing a ChatGPT watermark.





AI chatbots may appear as an omniscient entity, but they are not. They make mistakes, misunderstand things and can even be manipulated. Felix Simon, postdoctoral research fellow in AI and digital news and research associate at the Oxford Internet Institute (OII), concludes: ""AI systems such as Grok, Meta AI or ChatGPT should not be seen as fact-checking tools. While they can be used to that end with some success, it is unclear how well and consistently they perform at this task, especially for edge cases.""

For Canetta at Pagella Politica, AI chatbots can be useful for very simple fact checks. But he also advises people not to trust them entirely. Both experts stressed that users should always double-check responses with other sources.

DW,From emerald cities to ruby shoes: The curious colors of Oz,"As ""The Wizard of Oz"" turns 125, here are some colorful facts about its pop culture adaptations that include edible dye, Elton John and Technicolor tricks.

On May 17, 1900, US author Lyman Frank Baum published a tale that has since enchanted readers and viewers over generations with its unforgettable characters, magical settings and universal themes of courage, friendship and the search for home.

At the heart of the story is Dorothy Gale, a young girl living on a quiet Kansas farm. When a powerful tornado sweeps her and her dog Toto away, she finds herself in the fantastical Land of Oz, where wonder and danger lurk. Advised by a kind witch, Dorothy sets off for the Emerald City by following a Yellow Brick Road, hoping that the mysterious Wizard of Oz can help her return home.

Along the way, she befriends a Scarecrow wanting a brain, a Tin Man longing for a heart and a Cowardly Lion seeking courage. Together, they face trials, outwit a wicked witch and discover that the qualities they each sought lay within them all along.

Dorothy's magical ruby slippers — which she acquires after her tornado-borne house lands on and kills the Wicked Witch of the East — hold the final key to her return home.

Britannica, which describes it as ""a modern fairy tale with a distinctly American setting,"" also states that some consider the gutsy Dorothy as one of the first feminist heroes in children's literature.

Whether through film, stage or song, the diverse adaptations of the Land of Oz have since seen it evolve into a pop culture icon. But the visuals most often associated with it stem mainly from MGM's 1939 film adaptation starring then-16-year-old Judy Garland, whose wistful rendition of ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" was voted ""the greatest song of the 20th century"" in a 2001 joint survey by the National Endowment for the Arts and the Recording Industry Association of America.

On the book's 125th anniversary, here are some curious backstories on the colors that breathed life into ""The Wizard of Oz.""

In Baum's original book, Dorothy's enchanted footwear were silver — not ruby.

The 1939 film famously changed them to a glimmering red to take full advantage of the then-new Technicolor film process. Red simply popped better on screen as opposed to silver, and especially against the yellow bricks of the road.

One pair of these slippers worn by Judy Garland, stolen in 2005 from a Minnesota museum and recovered by the FBI in 2018, sold at auction for $28 million in 2024.

Way before CGI, there was food dye.

To recreate ""a horse of a different color"" — the dazzling, color-changing horse that greets Dorothy and friends in the Emerald City — four separate white horses were used to create the effect of a single horse that changes color from moment to moment.

The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals had objected to the horses' fur being dyed traditionally; the lore goes that technicians tinted them either with jello powder or food dye to create a spectrum of white, purple, red and yellow.

As the equine actors reportedly kept licking the colored powder off between takes, the scenes had to be shot as quickly as possible.

Curiously, what is known as the ""Emerald City"" is neither green nor built of emeralds. It appears so because everyone is required to wear green-tinted glasses — a clever ruse by the Wizard to create the illusion of grandeur.

The 1939 film, however, featured a literal green metropolis, thus forever cementing the Emerald City in popular culture as a glowing, green paradise.

There's also diverging takes online on whether Dorothy's gingham pinafore dress was blue and white or blue and pink. Some fan sites explain that what appeared to be blue and white, was in reality, blue and light pink. The costume team had apparently used pink — which rendered better on screen under the intense lighting of that era.

One cannot help but recall the color challenge on social media in early 2015, known as ""The Dress."" Remember? That viral phenomenon where a photograph of a dress sparked a debate on whether it was white and gold or blue and black, due to differences in color perception and how the brain interprets lighting.

Since its original publication, ""The Wizard of Oz"" has spawned colorful interpretations.

Singer Elton John's ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"" (1973), co-written with long-time collaborative partner Bernie Taupin, uses Oz imagery to symbolize disillusionment with fame and a yearning for a simpler life. The 78-year-old singer's final world tour was renamed ""Farewell Yellow Brick Road."" It began in Allentown, Pennsylvania, US, on September 8, 2018, and ended in Stockholm, Sweden, on July 8, 2023.

Meanwhile, 1978's ""The Wiz"" was an all-Black musical reimagining starring ex-Supremes singer Diana Ross as Dorothy and the late King of Pop Michael Jackson as the Scarecrow. Based on what was originally a successful Broadway musical, the film was widely panned by critics. But something more significant happened behind the scenes: It led veteran producer Quincy Jones to first cross paths with his future ""Thriller"" collaborator, Jackson.

And finally, Broadway's 2003 blockbuster ""Wicked"" flipped the script entirely, telling the untold story of the misunderstood ""Wicked Witch of the West"" Elphaba — complete with emerald skin and gravity-defying vocals. Incidentally, the musical's most recognizable number is, indeed, ""Defying Gravity.""

The musical, which is based on a novel of the same name, has since been adapted into a two-part film, with Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande leading the cast. The first part was released in 2024 and was nominated for 10 Oscars at the 97th Academy Awards, winning two — best costume design and production design.

DW,India's grip on global cricket tightening,"The appointment of Jay Shah as chairman of the International Cricket Council has seen India wield more power in cricket globally. DW looks at the country's growing influence and the links between sport and government.

Through its financial strength, political connections and media, India has long had a considerable influence over how cricket is played, broadcast and governed across the globe.

Concerns over what that means for other competing nations have increased following the unopposed election of the politically-connected Jay Shah as the chair of the International Cricket Council (ICC) last December. Shah still serves as secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).

The BCCI is the richest cricket board in the world and runs the Indian Premier League (IPL), one of sport's richest and most successful competitions. Between 2024 and 2027, it is projected to earn $1.15 billion (€1 billion) — nearly 39% of the ICC's total annual revenue.

This comes largely from the huge sums broadcasters pay for television rights for a market of over 1.4 billion people, allowing India to shape everything from tournament schedules to ICC media rights.



The IPL is deeply entwined with Indian politics. It is overseen by the BCCI, with the competition's current chairman Arun Dhumal —brother of lawmaker Anurag Thakur of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party — underscoring the direct overlap between political power and cricket governance. Thakur, himself, a former BCCI president, was removed in 2017 by the Supreme Court over mismanagement concerns.



Political influence in the IPL extends beyond leadership. Pakistani players, who featured in the 2008 inaugural season, have been effectively barred ever since the Mumbai terror attacks later that year. In response, the Indian government revoked their visas, and the BCCI quietly excluded them from all future player auctions.

Even IPL scheduling reflects political realities. In 2009, the entire tournament was shifted to South Africa, and in 2014, 20 matches were moved to the United Arab Emirates, as the Indian government said it couldn't guarantee security during national elections. The IPL's alignment with state priorities illustrates how cricket in India often mirrors — and serves — political interests.

The election of Shah, who is the son of Indian Home Minister Amit Shah, as ICC chair, has fueled concerns about the BCCI's level of control over global cricket.

This dual role breaks with prior norms, where the ICC chair was expected to be independent from any national cricket board. Critics have argued that this undermines the ICC's role as a neutral global governing body.

When Shah's predecessor, Greg Barclay, was elected to the post in 2020, he resigned as chair of New Zealand Cricket. When he stepped down as ICC chair four years later, he implicitly criticized his successor for not following suit.

""We're really lucky to have India,"" Barclay said in an interview with UK newspaper The Telegraph in December. ""They're a massive contributor to the game across all the measures, but one country having that amount of power and influence does distort a whole lot of other outcomes, which is not necessarily helpful in terms of that global growth.""

Shah has not commented on his possible conflicts of interest since his appointment in December. At the time, he said: ""I am committed to working closely with the ICC team and all of our member nations to further globalize cricket.""



Gautam Gambhir, former Indian opener and current head coach of the national team, has also played a prominent dual role in both cricket and politics. In 2019, he joined the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, saying: ""I have been influenced by the prime minister (Narendra Modi), his vision for the country. This is a fabulous platform for me to do something for the country.""



In March 2024, he announced his exit from active politics to return full-time to cricket, before taking on the head coach role for the national team.

Following a deadly attack in Kashmir in 2025, Gambhir called for a complete freeze on bilateral cricket with Pakistan. He argued that national security should take precedence over sporting diplomacy — though this was not a stance the BCCI or BJP themselves spoke of publicly.

India's influence in cricket is visible in its relationship with Pakistan. The two countries have not played a bilateral series since 2013, largely due to political tensions following military escalations and terror-related incidents.

Shah's influence after being appointed chair of cricket's global governing body was clearly shown at the start of 2025.

While Pakistan had participated in the 2023 ICC World Cup held in India under heavy security restrictions, in November 2024 India's government refused permission for their cricket team to travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy the following year.

After a series of compromises and negotiations, the PCB agreed to a reciprocal deal where Pakistan's matches in ICC events hosted by India for the next five years would also be played at neutral venues, under Shah's watch. But Lahore was denied hosting the Champions Trophy final, after India qualified for the showpiece.

According to a May 2025 investigation by British daily The Guardian, Sanjog Gupta, head of sports at Jiostar — India's largest media conglomerate — is the leading candidate to become the next ICC CEO when Geoff Allardice vacates the role in July.

Jiostar holds a $3 billion broadcasting rights deal for ICC events. If Gupta assumes the role, both the ICC chair and CEO would be Indian nationals overseeing a structure where Indian broadcasters hold the largest financial stake.

India's rise as the superpower of world cricket is rooted in its financial weight, but it's now sustained by political influence and media control.

While this has brought modernization and commercialization to sport, it has also created a monopolistic structure that threatens the game's diversity and equity to the detriment of Pakistan and other, smaller cricketing nations.

BBC,France to open high-security prison in Amazon jungle,"France will build a new high-security prison in its overseas territory of French Guiana to house drug traffickers and radical Islamists, the country's justice minister announced during a visit to the territory.

Gérald Darmanin told Le Journal du Dimanche (JDD) newspaper that the prison would target organised crime ""at all levels"" of the drug supply chain.

The €400m (£337m) facility, which could open as early as 2028, will be built in an isolated location deep in the Amazon jungle in the northwestern region of Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni.

The plan was announced after a series of violent incidents linked to criminal gangs which saw prisons and staff targeted across France in recent months.

The prison will hold up to 500 people, with a separate wing designed to house the most dangerous criminals.

In an interview with JDD, the minister said the new prison would be governed by an ""extremely strict carceral regime"" designed to ""incapacitate the most dangerous drug traffickers"".

Darmanin said the facility would be used to detain people ""at the beginning of the drug trail"", as well as serving as a ""lasting means of removing the heads of the drug trafficking networks"" in mainland France.

French Guiana is a region of France on the north-east coast of South America. Its residents are eligible to vote in French elections and have access to the French social security system, as well as other subsidies.

Its distance from the French mainland means drug lords ""will no longer be able to have any contact with their criminal networks"", Darmanin told JDD.

French authorities have long struggled to control the infiltration of mobile phones into the prison network. Tens of thousands are known to circulate through French jails.

Earlier this year, the French government announced new legislation designed to crack down on the activity of criminal gangs.

The measures will create a dedicated branch of the prosecutors' office to deal with organised crime. It will also introduce extra powers for investigators, and a special protected status for informers.

It will also see the creation of new high-security prisons - including the facility in French Guiana - to hold the most powerful drugs barons, with stricter rules governing visits and communication with the outside world.

France has seen a series of attacks on prisons in recent months, which Darmanin has described as ""terrorist"" incidents that come in response to the government's new legislation.

The perpetrators of these attacks have set vehicles outside prisons alight, while Toulon's La Farlede prison was hit by gunfire.

In some incidents the perpetrators of these attacks have styled themselves as defenders of prisoners' rights.

The proposed new facility in French Guiana is to be built at a ""strategic crossroads"" for drugs mules, particularly from Brazil and Suriname, according to AFP news agency.

Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni is the former port of entry to the infamous Devil's Island penal colony, where 70,000 convicts from mainland France were sent between 1852 and 1954.

The penal colony was the setting of French writer Henri Charrière's book Papillon, which was later made into a Hollywood film starring Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman.

The BBC has contacted the French justice ministry for comment.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7v7n81emy3o,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z
BBC,Solving the mystery of a dinosaur mass grave at the 'River of Death',"Hidden beneath the slopes of a lush forest in Alberta, Canada, is a mass grave on a monumental scale.

Thousands of dinosaurs were buried here, killed in an instant on a day of utter devastation.

Now, a group of palaeontologists have come to Pipestone Creek - appropriately nicknamed the ""River of Death"" - to help solve a 72-million-year-old enigma: how did they die?

Trying to work out exactly what happened here starts with the hefty strike of a sledgehammer.

Brute force is needed to crack open the thick layer of rock that covers what Professor Emily Bamforth, who's leading the dig, describes as ""palaeo gold"".

As her team begins the more delicate job of removing the layers of dirt and dust, a jumble of fossilised bones slowly begins to emerge.

""That big blob of bone right there is, we think, part of a hip,"" Prof Bamforth says, watched on by her dog Aster - whose job today is to bark if she spots any nearby bears.

""Then here, we have all of these long, skinny bones. These are all ribs. And this is a neat one - it's part of a toe bone. This one here, we have no idea what it is - it's a great example of a Pipestone Creek mystery.""

BBC News has come to Pipestone Creek to witness the sheer scale of this prehistoric graveyard and see how researchers are piecing together the clues.

Thousands of fossils have been collected from the site, and are constantly generating new discoveries.

The bones all belong to a dinosaur called Pachyrhinosaurus. The species, and Prof Bamforth's excavation, feature in a new landmark BBC series - Walking With Dinosaurs - which uses visual effects and science to bring this prehistoric world to life.

These animals, which lived during the Late Cretaceous period, were a relative of the Triceratops. Measuring about five metres long and weighing two tonnes, the four-legged beasts had large heads, adorned with a distinctive bony frill and three horns. Their defining feature was a big bump on the nose called a boss.

The dig season has just started and lasts each year until autumn. The fossils in the small patch of ground that the team are working on are incredibly tightly packed; Prof Bamforth estimates there are up to 300 bones in every square metre.

So far, her team has excavated an area the size of a tennis court, but the bed of bones extends for a kilometre into the hillside.

""It's jaw dropping in terms of its density,"" she tells us.

""It is, we believe, one of the largest bone beds in North America.

""More than half of the known dinosaur species in the world are described from a single specimen. We have thousands of Pachyrhinosaurus here.""

Palaeontologists believe the dinosaurs were migrating together in a colossal herd for hundreds of miles from the south - where they had spent the winter - to the north for the summer.

The area, which had a much warmer climate than it does today, would have been covered in rich vegetation, providing abundant food for this enormous group of plant-eating animals.

""It is a single community of a single species of animal from a snapshot in time, and it's a huge sample size. That almost never happens in the fossil record,"" says Prof Bamforth.

And this patch of north-western Alberta wasn't just home to Pachyrhinosaurus. Even bigger dinosaurs roamed this land, and studying them is essential to try and understand this ancient ecosystem.

Two hours drive away, we reach the Deadfall Hills. Getting there involves a hike through dense forest, wading - or doggy-paddling in the case of Aster - across a fast-running river, and clambering over slippery rocks.

No digging is required here; super-sized bones lie next to the shoreline, washed out from the rock and cleaned by the flowing water, just waiting to be picked up.

A huge vertebra is quickly spotted, as are bits of ribs and teeth scattered across the mud.

Palaeontologist Jackson Sweder is particularly interested in what looks like a chunk of dinosaur skull. ""Most of what we find here is a duck-billed dinosaur called Edmontosaurus. If this is a skull bone, this is a dinosaur that's large - probably 30ft (10m) long,"" he says.

The Edmontosaurus, another herbivore, roamed the forests like the Pachyrhinosaurus - and is helping palaeontologists build up a picture of this ancient land.

Sweder is the collection manager at the Philip J Currie Dinosaur Museum in nearby Grande Prairie, where the bones from both of these giants are taken to be cleaned up and analysed. He is currently working on a huge Pachyrhinosaurus skull that's about 1.5m long and has been nicknamed ""Big Sam"".

He points to where the three horns should be at the top of the frill, but the one in the middle is missing. ""All the skulls that are decently complete have a spike in that spot,"" he says. ""But its nice little unicorn spike doesn't seem to be there.""

Throughout years working at the extraordinary site, the museum team has collected 8,000 dinosaur bones, and the surfaces of the lab are covered in fossils; there are bones from Pachyrhinosaurus of every size, from young to old.

Having material from so many animals allows researchers to learn about dinosaur biology, answering questions about how the species grows and the make-up of the community. They can also look at individual variations, to see how one Pachyrhinosaurus could stand out from the herd – as may be the case with Big Sam and his missing spike.

All of this detailed research, in the museum and at the two sites, is helping the team to answer the vital question: how did so many animals in Pipestone Creek die at the same time?

""We believe that this was a herd on a seasonal migration that got tangled up in some catastrophic event that effectively wiped out, if not the entire herd, then a good proportion of it,"" Prof Bamforth says.

All the evidence suggests that this catastrophic event was a flash flood - perhaps a storm over the mountains that sent an unstoppable torrent of water towards the herd, ripping trees from their roots and shifting boulders.

Prof Bamforth says the Pachyrhinosaurus wouldn't have stood a chance. ""These animals are not able to move very fast because of their sheer numbers, and they're very top heavy - and really not very good at swimming at all.""

Rocks found at the site show the swirls of sediment from the fast-flowing water churning everything up. It's as if the destruction is frozen in time as a wave in the stone.

But this nightmare day for the dinosaurs is now a dream for palaeontologists.

""We know, every time we come here, it's 100% guaranteed we'll find bones. And every year we discover something new about the species,"" says Prof Bamforth.

""That's why we keep coming back, because we're still finding new things.""

As the team packs up their tools ready to return another day, they know there's a lot of work ahead. They've only just scratched the surface of what's here - and there are many more prehistoric secrets just waiting to be revealed.

BBC,Mexico mourns Navy cadets killed in Brooklyn Bridge ship crash,"Mexicans are mourning the death of two young Navy cadets who were killed on Saturday when the training tall ship ARM Cuauhtémoc crashed into Brooklyn Bridge.

América Sánchez, 20, and 23-year-old Adal Jair Maldonado Marcos were among the 277 crew members on board the Mexican Navy's sailing ship when its three masts snapped as they hit the bridge.

According to Mexican media, Sánchez was one of the cadets who was standing on top of the masts at the time of the accident.

Twenty-two other crew members were injured, three of them critically, the Mexican Navy said.

The commander of the Mexican Navy, Admiral Pedro Raymundo Morales, said all the crew members well enough to travel would be taken back to their homeland soon.

The body of América Sánchez is scheduled to be transferred to the Naval Academy in her home state of Veracruz later on Monday.

Her mother, Rocío Hernández, described the 20-year-old cadet as ""an exemplary daughter"" who was ""a dedicated student"" aiming to become a naval engineer.

Standing before an impromptu altar adorned with flowers and photos of América Sánchez dressed up for her ""quinceañera"", the party marking her 15th birthday, Ms Hernández paid tribute to her daughter.

""She was a warrior, a soldier who didn't give up, who always fought for her goals,"" she said, adding that her daughter only had one year left until her graduation.

""They [the Navy] will hold a private ceremony in her honour at the Veracruz Naval Academy for her and then I will bring her home,"" Ms Hernández said thanking all of her daughter's relatives, friends and teachers, whom she asked ""to remember her [América]  with affection"".

In San Mateo del Mar, a coastal town in Oaxaca state, friends and relatives of Adal Jair Maldonado Marcos have also been paying their respects after the young cadet was confirmed as the second fatal victim of the crash.

His friends told local media that the 23-year-old had always dreamt of following in his father's footsteps and becoming a sailor.

Being on board the Cuauhtémoc, also known as ""Knight of the Seas"", had been his greatest wish, they recalled.

""The sea saw him being born and the sea was a witness to his passing,"" one friend to media, adding that ""all of us who knew him will remember him as a role model of an intelligent youth"".

The investigation into how the accident happened is still under way.

New York police officials said it appeared that the Cuauhtémoc had lost power as it was leaving New York Harbour and was dragged towards Brooklyn Bridge by the current.

Its three masts, measuring more than 48m, hit the base of the bridge, which -according to the New York transport department's website - only has a clearance of  41.1m.

All three masts collapsed and video footage taken by bystanders shows some of the crew members dangling from the yards and sails.

Mexico's Navy Secretary Raymundo Pedro Morales Ángeles said in a statement the results of any investigation would be followed with ""total transparency and responsibility"".

The Cuauhtémoc left Acapulco, Mexico, on 6 April on a tour that included stops in New York and Aberdeen, Scotland, for the city's Tall Ships race in July.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7807vexn0go,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z
BBC,Pope Leo XIV holds Vatican talks with JD Vance,"Pope Leo XIV has held ""cordial"" talks with US Vice-President JD Vance, according to the Vatican.

It comes a day after Vance - a practicing Catholic - joined other dignitaries and thousands of worshipers at the Pope's inaugural mass on Sunday.

After Pope Leo became the first American to lead the Roman Catholic Church earlier this month, it emerged he had previously appeared to make veiled criticisms of Vance and the wider Trump administration's migration stance.

In a statement, the Holy See said both sides had expressed satisfaction with relations between the US and Vatican during face-to-face talks on Monday.

Religious freedom and cooperation between church and state were also discussed at the meeting, with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio also taking part.

A statement continued: ""Finally, there was an exchange of views on current international issues with a shared call for respect for humanitarian and international law in conflict zones, and support for negotiated solutions among the parties involved.""

The papal audience lasted 45 minutes, Vance's spokesperson said. It took place behind closed doors without reporters present.

The Vatican said Vance also held positive talks with Archbishop Paul Richard Gallagher, who is responsible for the Holy See's diplomatic relations.

In February, an X account under Leo's name shared criticism of the White House's plans for mass deportations of migrants.

That same month, the account also shared a link to an opinion piece titled: ""JD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn't ask us to rank our love for others.""

The Vatican has not responded to previous requests from BBC News to confirm whether the account belonged to Pope Leo.

On Sunday, Vance said the United States was ""very proud"" of the Chicago-born pontiff.

""Certainly our prayers go with him as he starts this very important work,"" the vice-president said.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g2rpn3p9ro,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z
BBC,Joe Biden diagnosed with 'aggressive' prostate cancer,"Former US President Joe Biden, 82, has been diagnosed with prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, a statement from his office said on Sunday.

The discovery was made on Friday after he reported urinary symptoms which led doctors to find a small nodule on his prostate.

The cancer is a more aggressive form of the disease and Biden and his family are reviewing treatment options, the statement said.

He left office in January as the oldest serving US president in history and questions about his health dogged his first term, leading him to end his run for re-election late in his campaign.

In Sunday's statement, Biden's office said: ""Last week, President Joe Biden was seen for a new finding of a prostate nodule after experiencing increasing urinary symptoms.

""On Friday, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, characterised by a Gleason score of 9 (Grade Group 5) with metastasis to the bone.

""While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management.""

A Gleason score of nine means his illness is classified as ""high-grade"" and the cancer cells could spread quickly, according to Cancer Research UK.

After news broke of his diagnosis, the former president received support from both sides of the aisle.

President Donald Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social that he and First Lady Melania Trump were ""saddened to hear about Joe Biden's recent medical diagnosis"".

""We extend our warmest and best wishes to Jill and the family,"" he said, referring to former First Lady Jill Biden. ""We wish Joe a fast and successful recovery.""

Former Vice-President Kamala Harris, who served under Biden, wrote on X that she and her husband Doug Emhoff are keeping the Biden family in their prayers.

""Joe is a fighter – and I know he will face this challenge with the same strength, resilience, and optimism that have always defined his life and leadership,"" Harris said.

In a post on X, Barack Obama –  who served as president from 2009 to 2017 with Joe Biden as his deputy –  said that he and his wife Michelle were ""thinking of the entire Biden family"".

""Nobody has done more to find breakthrough treatments for cancer in all its forms than Joe, and I am certain he will fight this challenge with his trademark resolve and grace. We pray for a fast and full recovery,"" Obama said. In 2016, Obama tasked Biden with leading a ""cancer moonshot"" government-wide research programme.

In the UK, Prime Minister Keir Starmer said: ""I am very sorry to hear President Biden has prostate cancer. All the very best to Joe, his wife Jill and their family, and wishing the president swift and successful treatment.""

The news comes nearly a year after the former president was forced to drop out of the 2024 US presidential election over concerns about his health and age.

Biden, then the Democratic nominee vying for re-election, faced mounting criticism of his poor performance in a June televised debate against Republican nominee and current president Donald Trump.

He was replaced as the Democratic candidate by his vice-president, Kamala Harris.

Trump, 78, became the oldest person to take the oath when he took over from Biden.

Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer affecting men, behind skin cancer, according to the Cleveland Clinic. The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that 13 out of every 100 men will develop prostate cancer at some point in their lives.

Age is the most common risk factor, the CDC says.

Dr William Dahut, the Chief Scientific Officer at the American Cancer Society and a trained prostate cancer physician, told the BBC that the cancer is more aggressive in nature, based on the publicly-available information on Biden's diagnosis.

""In general, if cancer has spread to the bones, we don't think it is considered a curable cancer,"" Dr Dahut said.

He noted, however, that most patients tend to respond well to initial treatment, ""and people can live many years with the diagnosis"".

Dr Dahut said that someone with the former president's diagnosis will likely be offered hormonal therapies to mitigate symptoms and to slow the growth of cancerous cells.

Biden had largely retreated from the public eye since leaving the White House and he has made few public appearances.

In May, he sat down for an interview with the BBC - his first since leaving the White House - where he admitted that the decision to step down from the 2024 race was ""difficult"".

Biden has faced questions about the status of his health in recent months.

In an appearance on The View programme that also took place in May, Biden denied claims that he had been experiencing cognitive decline in his final year at the White House. ""There is nothing to sustain that,"" he said.

For many years, the president had advocated for cancer research.

In 2022, he and Mrs Biden relaunched the ""cancer moonshot"" initiative with the goal of mobilising research efforts to prevent more than four million cancer deaths by the year 2047.

Biden himself lost his eldest son, Beau, to brain cancer in 2015.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwywqg7lq1zo,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z
BBC,Olympic star 'broken' by top swim coach's regime,"A world record-breaking swimmer has told BBC Panorama she was left ""broken"" by the harsh regime run by one of the UK's most successful swimming coaches.

Rūta Meilutytė, who won gold at the London 2012 Olympics, said Jon Rudd's focus on weighing and swimmers' diets contributed to her struggle with an eating disorder and depression.

In total, 12 ex-swimmers have told us they experienced bullying, a toxic training environment and controlling food culture at one of the UK's most prestigious clubs for young elite swimmers when he was head coach.

Rudd had faced allegations of bullying and verbal abuse during his 28-year tenure at Plymouth Leander swimming club, but the BBC has learned that no action was taken by the sport's governing body.

We have found that Swim England, the governing body, did not act on a confidential 2012 investigation which ruled Rudd should be suspended after hearing evidence about his behaviour from 17 witnesses.

Swim England's new chief executive Andy Salmon said he did not know why Rudd had not been suspended, but he was ""deeply, deeply, sorry"" to Plymouth's swimmers and all of those harmed by the governing body's failings.

Rudd, who is due to become high performance director of Saudi Arabia's Olympic swimming team, has not responded to the BBC.

Plymouth Leander attracted aspiring swimmers from around the world after Rudd established its reputation as a club that produced Olympic athletes.

While head coach between 1989 and 2017, he was responsible for swimmers' success, but also had safeguarding responsibilities to ensure their wellbeing.

One of Plymouth Leander's most successful swimmers was Antony James,  who won silver at the 2010 Commonwealth Games and represented Team GB at the 2012 Olympics. He was jailed for 21 years in February for raping two girls he had met at the club.

Three people who trained at Plymouth Leander told Panorama that Rudd, who had coached James since he was eight years old, should have known he was interested in younger girls.

A former girlfriend of James, also an ex-swimmer, said he was well known for mixing with young teenage girls and that his status as the club's ""golden boy"" meant no one questioned his behaviour.

""Everyone knew - he wasn't trying to hide anything that he was doing, it was very out there and open,"" she said.

She was 16 and he was 22 when they started a relationship and she says she believes she was a ""gateway"" to his grooming of younger girls.

Rudd was a coach at Plymouth Leander in 2010 when Lithuanian Rūta Meilutyte moved to the UK to be coached by him.

She made Olympic history two years later when, aged 15, she became the youngest person to win the 100m breaststroke.

Now 28, she recalls Rudd making cutting comments about her weight.

When she confided in him that she had been making herself sick after meals to lose weight, she said he laughed and replied: ""Well, at least you get the calories out.""

She said that Rudd did seek help for her once he realised that she was not happy with what he had said.

She also described him saying her ""ass was fat"", moments before a major competition, aged 16.

Despite being hailed as the club's most successful swimmer, Meilutytė said Rudd's regime ""made me for a while and then it broke me"".

She left Plymouth Leander in 2017. Rudd's career, meanwhile, went from strength to strength, with him becoming Swim Ireland's director of performance swimming in the same year.

Rudd was employed by Plymouth College, an independent school, until 2017. It ran a partnership with Plymouth Leander between 2001-2024 and many swimmers boarded there.

Among the other 11 swimmers to make allegations to Panorama about Rudd was Olympic bronze medallist Cassie Patten. She said the coach had made her train with an injured shoulder and that it eventually ended her career in 2011.

Commonwealth Youth gold medallist Phoebe Lenderyou told Panorama Rudd's regime aggravated her eating disorder.

Andy Salmon, who has been CEO of Swim England since February 2024, confirmed to the BBC that no action was taken against Rudd despite evidence swimmers had suffered harm and the 2012 report's recommendation that he be suspended for four months.

The report would have remained a secret but for the BBC receiving a tip-off in 2023. It said Rudd had been subjected to a lengthy probe, but that none of the complainants had been told the outcome.

His case was reviewed after the BBC asked Swim England about it.

According to the original investigation, Rudd's assistant coach, Lindsay Trimmings, should also have been suspended from Plymouth Leander. She was later hired by Swim England to be its head of coaching but left in 2023. When Panorama wrote to her, she said she did not want to respond.

""Clearly the organisation failed to act on the independent recommendations made at the time. And I'm really sorry, on behalf of Swim England, for any suffering that that might have led to,"" Mr Salmon told us.

The failings of the 2012 investigation into Rudd have led to the governing body announcing it would review 1,500 safeguarding cases carried out across England between 2002 and 2022.

Swim England commissioned a listening report into all aquatic sports after the BBC first shared multiple swimmers' accounts of mistreatment in 2023. Published in 2024, the governing body's report found a culture of fear at all levels of the sport that threatened its future.

Plymouth Leander said it was ""deeply concerned by the nature and severity"" of Panorama's allegations, stating that the club was ""fundamentally different"" from when Rudd was in charge. It also said it had conducted a ""thorough review"" of its safeguarding policies and procedures to provide ""the safest possible environment"".

It said Rudd's employer, Plymouth College, was responsible for his ""oversight and jurisdiction"".

Plymouth College, which is now under different ownership, said the club was responsible for safeguarding and that it was ""deeply concerned to hear these testimonies from swimmers who trained at Plymouth Leander"".

It said the partnership with Plymouth Leander had been terminated and it now ran its own swimming organisation, Plymouth College Aquatics (PCA).

BBC Panorama has also found evidence of a bullying culture at Royal Wolverhampton School Swimming Club, another leading institution in the sport, as recently as last year.

Complaints about the behaviour of David Painter, the club's head coach at the time were made by the parents of 11 swimmers, during 2023 and 2024.

One of the swimmers, Abby, now 17, told the BBC she was forced to choose between her education and swimming because Painter would not let her have time off to prepare for her GCSEs.

She attended a different school several miles away but said she was told she would still have to train on the morning of exams.

""Towards the end I was literally having full blown panic attacks,"" said Abby, who told Panorama she was failing at school. She eventually decided to leave the sport.

Alison Hickman, the club's former welfare officer, told the BBC she had given the names of 11 parents who had concerns about Painter to Swim England and said none of them were contacted by the governing body.

Swim England told the BBC it had asked the school to resolve the issues.

The Royal Wolverhampton School said complaints were confidential. It said the school has ""clear safeguarding procedures"" and ""all formal complaints are investigated swiftly and appropriately"".

Painter, who left to coach in Canada last year, said his ""commitment to athlete development and wellbeing has always been at the core"" of his coaching, and that he had never been subject to ""any disciplinary investigations or hearings"". He added that the allegations against him were ""untrue… and defamatory"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4gmm2zv8no,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z
BBC,Indian YouTuber arrested for allegedly 'spying' for Pakistan,"Police in India have arrested a local YouTuber on suspicions of spying for Pakistan.

Jyoti Malhotra, a travel influencer from the northern Indian state of Haryana, allegedly travelled to the neighbouring country several times - her last trip was in March 2025.

Police in Haryana allege that she was in touch with a Pakistan High Commission official, who was expelled from India earlier this month.

The YouTuber's father has denied allegations that she was a spy, saying she went to Pakistan after acquiring necessary permissions.

Ms Malhotra describes herself on social media as a ""modern girl with old ideas"", and has 377,000 subscribers on YouTube and 133,000 followers on Instagram.

But officers have questioned how she financed her travel around the globe, with her videos documenting visits to places like  Bangladesh, China, Thailand, United Arab Emirates and Indonesia. She has also visited several Indian destinations and religious places. Police say it defies her known source of income.

Police claim Ms Malhotra was in touch with ""Pakistani intelligence operatives"" and had continuous contact with a Pakistani citizen.

Ms Malhotra is also being investigated for any links with the Pahalgam attack, Shashank Kumar Sawan, the superintendent of police in Haryana's Hisar district, told ANI news agency.

They say they have leads on others who may have collaborated with the influencer, who does not have direct access to any military or defence information.

""She was in touch with other YouTube influencers... She used to go to Pakistan on sponsored trips,"" Mr Sawan added.

Her arrest comes after the Indian government asked Ahsan-ur-Rahim, the Pakistan High Commission official with whom the YouTuber was alleged to have been in contact, to leave the country on 13 May, alleging he had indulged in activities ""not in keeping with his official status in India"".

Pakistan also asked an Indian embassy staff member in Islamabad to leave for indulging in activities ""incompatible"" with his privileged status.

According to a complaint registered by the police, Ms Malhotra met Ahsan-ur-Rahim for the first time in 2023 when she had visited the Pakistan High Commission in Delhi, seeking a visa to visit the neighbouring country.

Her last video on Pakistan was uploaded in March, in which she was seen in the Pakistan High Commission in Delhi attending a Ramadan dinner.

In other videos from Pakistan, she is seen visiting Hindu and Sikh temples, famous local markets, and interacting with locals.

Arrests in India and Pakistan over allegations of spying are not uncommon.

Ms Malhotra's arrest comes following days of military tensions between the neighbours earlier this month.

On 7 May, India struck what it calls ""terror infrastructure"" inside Pakistan, days after a deadly militant attack on tourists in Pahalgam, a picturesque valley in Indian-administered Kashmir. Pakistan has denied any involvement in the attacks.

After four tense days of deadly clashes between the nuclear-armed neighbours, both countries agreed to a ceasefire on 10 May, announced by US President Donald Trump.

BBC,The secretive US factory that lays bare the contradiction in Trump's America First plan,"Among the cactuses in the desert of Arizona, just outside Phoenix, an extraordinary collection of buildings is emerging that will shape the future of the global economy and the world.

The hum of further construction is creating not just a factory for the world's most advanced semiconductors. Eventually, it will mass produce the most advanced chips in the world. This work is being done in the US for the first time, with the Taiwanese company behind it pledging to spend billions more here in a move aimed at heading off the threat of tariffs on imported chips.

It is, in my view, the most important factory in the world, and it's being built by a company you may not have heard of: TSMC, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. It makes 90% of the world's advanced semiconductors. Until now they were all made on the island of Taiwan, which is 100 miles east of the Chinese mainland. The Apple chip in your iPhone, the Nvidia chips powering your ChatGPT queries, the chips in your laptop or computer network, all are made by TSMC.

Its Arizona facility ""Fab 21"" is closely guarded. Blank paper or personal devices are not allowed in case designs are leaked. It houses some of the most important intellectual property in the world, and the process to make these chips is one of the most complicated and intensive in global manufacturing.

They're hugely protective of the secrets that lie within. Important customers, such as Apple and Nvidia, trust this company to safeguard their designs for future products.

But after months of asking, TSMC let the BBC in to look at the partial transfer of what some argue is the most critical, expensive, complex and important manufacturing in the world.

President Trump certainly seems to think so. He often mentions the factory in passing. ""TSMC is the biggest there is,"" he has said. ""We gradually lost the chip business, and now it's almost exclusively in Taiwan. They stole it from us."" This is one of the US president's regular refrains.

TSMC's recent decision to expand its investments in the US by a further $100bn (£75bn) is something Trump attributes to his threats of tariffs on Taiwan and on the global semiconductor business.

The expansion of the Arizona facility, which was announced in March is, he believes, the poster child for his economic policies - in particular the encouragement of foreign companies to relocate factories to the US to avoid hefty tariffs.

China is also watching developments carefully. Taiwan's chip-making prowess has been part of what its government has called its ""Silicon Shield"", against a much-feared invasion. While the original strategy was to make Taiwan indispensable in this area of critical technology, the pandemic supply chain difficulties changed the calculus because relying on a single country seemed like a greater risk.

China claims the self-ruled Taiwan as its territory but Taiwan sees itself as distinct from the Chinese mainland.

So, many currents of the world economy, frontier technology and geopolitics flow through this one site and within it lies the essential contradiction of Trump's economic and diplomatic policy.

He sees this plant as the exemplar of America First, and the preservation of economic and military superiority over China. Yet the manufacture of these modern miniaturised miracles at the frontier of physics and chemistry inherently relies on a combination of the very best technologies from around the world.

Greg Jackson, one of the facilities managers, takes me around in a golf buggy. The factories are almost a carbon copy of the TSMC spaces in Taiwan, where he trained. ""I would say these facilities are probably some of the most advanced and complicated in the world,"" he says.

""It's quite the dichotomy. You've got really, really small chips with really small structures, and it takes this massive facility with all the infrastructure to be able to make them... Just the sheer complexity, the amount of systems that it takes, is staggering.""

Inside the ""Gowning Building"", workers dress in protective clothing before crossing a bridge that is supposed to create the cleanest environment on Earth, in order to protect the production of these extraordinary microscopic transistors that create the microchips underpinning everything.

Konstantinos Ninios, an engineer, shows me some of the very first productions from TSMC Arizona: a silicon wafer with what is known as ""4 nanometre chips"".

""This is the most advanced wafer in the US right now,"" he explains. ""[It] contains about 10 to 14 trillion transistors... The whole process is 3,000 to 4,000 steps.""

If you could somehow shrink your body to the same scale and get inside the wafer, he says that the many different layers would look like very tall streets and skyscrapers.

TSMC was founded at the behest of the Taiwanese government in 1987, when chip executive Morris Chang was directed to start the business. The model was to become a dedicated foundry for microchips, manufacturing other companies' designs. It became wildly successful.

Driving the advancement of the technology is the miniaturisation of the smallest feature on chips. Their size is measured these days in billionths of a metre or nanometres. This progress has enabled mobile phones to become smartphones, and is now setting the pace for the mass deployment of artificial intelligence.

It requires incredible complexity and expense through the use of ""extreme ultraviolet (UV) light"". This is used to etch the intricate building blocks of our modern existence in a process called ""lithography"".

The world's dependence on TSMC is built on highly specialised bus-sized machines, which are in turn sourced almost entirely from a Dutch company called ASML, including in Arizona.

These machines shoot UV light tens of thousands of times through drops of molten tin, which creates a plasma, and is then refracted through a series of specialised mirrors.

The almost entirely automated process for each wafer of silicon is repeated thousands of times in layers over months, before the $1m LP-sized wafer of 4nm silicon chips is formed.

""Just imagine a particle or a dust particle falling into this,"" Mr Ninios says to me incredulously. ""The transistors are not going to work. So all of this is cleaner than hospital operating rooms.""

Taiwan does not have special access to the raw materials - but it has the know-how to stay years ahead of other companies in the intricate process of producing these atomic building blocks of modern life.

Some in the Taiwanese government are cautious about spreading the frontier of this technology off the island. Trump wasted little time in claiming the firm's decision to bring its highest level of technology to the US was due to his economic policies.

He said this would not have happened without the stick of his planned tariffs on Taiwan and semiconductors. Those I speak to at TSMC are diplomatic about that claim.

Much of this was already planned and subsidised under former US President Biden's Chips Act.

On the walkway into the building are photographs showing Biden's visit in 2022, with the building site draped in the Stars and Stripes and a banner saying ""a future Made in America"".

""The semiconductor supply chain is global,"" says TSMC Arizona President Rose Castanares. ""There's really no single country at this moment that can do everything from chemicals to wafer manufacturing to packaging, and so it's very difficult to unwind that whole thing very quickly.""

As for the semiconductor supply chain, tariffs will not help. The supply chain stretches all over the world. Whether it's the silicon wafers from Japan, the machines required from the Netherlands, or mirrors from Germany, all sorts of materials from all around the world are required. Now, they could face import charges.

That said, TSMC's boss was quick off the mark in confirming the expansion of the US site at an event with Trump at the White House. In recent weeks, America's tech elite - from Apple's Tim Cook, to Nvidia's Jensen Huang - have been queueing up to tell the world that TSMC Arizona will now produce many of the chips in their US products.

The global chip industry is very sensitive to the economic cycle, but its cutting-edge technology enjoys very healthy margins, that could cushion some of these planned tariffs.

There are many geopolitical subtexts here. The factory sits at the heart of US strategy to gain technological, AI and economic supremacy over China.

Both the Biden and Trump administrations have developed policies to try and limit Chinese access to the frontier semiconductor technology - from a ban on exports to China of ASML's machines, to new legislation to ban the use of Huawei AI chips in US software or technology anywhere in the world.

Taiwan's President Lai this week urged democracies such as Japan and the US to develop ""non-Red"" supply chains to counter China.

Not everyone is convinced that this strategy is working, however. Chinese technologists have been effective at working around the bans to develop competitive indigenous technology. And Bill Gates this week said that these policies ""have forced the Chinese in terms of chip manufacturing and everything to go full speed ahead"".

Trump wants TSMC Arizona to become a foundation stone for his American golden age. But the company's story to date is perhaps the ultimate expression of the success of modern globalisation.

So for now, it's a battle for global tech and economic supremacy, in which Taiwan's factory technology, some of which is now being moved to the Arizona desert, is the critical asset.

BBC,Starmer banks on public being over Brexit,"This is undeniably a significant deal. In a funny way, though, for Sir Keir Starmer to succeed he needs it to seem as insignificant and uncontroversial as possible.

For many in politics, wading through the details of this agreement will be an act of nostalgia – or perhaps deeply triggering.

Dynamic alignment. Sanitary and phytosanitary checks. Fishing quotas. Jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.

These are concepts, institutions and trade-offs which came to dominate British politics for much of the past decade. And with good reason: as the UK navigated its divorce with the EU, these technical questions became deeply political as they shaped the post-Brexit relationship.

Sir Keir's big bet is that nobody really cares any more. The view at the top of government is that there is no public clamour to reopen the biggest questions of Brexit – membership of the single market and customs union – but that making the relationship smoother within those parameters is mere pragmatic common sense.

Of course pragmatism lies in the eyes of the beholder. The Conservatives have lambasted the deal as ""surrender"", attacking both the 12-year extension to existing fishing quotas and the commitment for the UK to follow EU rules on agriculture.

Reform UK, in many ways the successor to the Brexit Party and UKIP, are unsurprisingly making a similar argument.

On the other side of the equation, the Liberal Democrats welcomed ""some positive first steps"" but urged the prime minister to ""be more ambitious"".

Their position is that the UK should rejoin the EU's customs union - an agreement between member states not to charge tariffs on each other's goods.

What will prove revealing over the coming days, weeks, and months is not just those opposition parties' positions but how much they campaign on them.

If opposition to today's deal becomes a significant part of these parties' platforms, it will tell us that they believe there is in fact plenty of controversy yet in the decades-long debate over the UK's relationship with the EU.

If that's right, then today's main significance may prove to have been thrusting questions about Brexit right back to the centre of political life.

But if Sir Keir is right that the bulk of the public simply wants as little friction with the EU as possible, then he could prove to be our first truly post-Brexit prime minister.

BBC,Biden's cancer diagnosis is another formidable challenge,"Joe Biden's half-century in politics has been an exercise in overcoming adversity.

From the death of his wife and young daughter in a car accident in 1972, to two early and unsuccessful presidential bids, to the death of his eldest son at just 46, his decades in Washington have been defined by tragedy but often followed by triumph.

Now, just four months after leaving office as a one-term president, and as intense scrutiny is placed on his mental and physical decline during those four years, the 82-year-old has been diagnosed with aggressive and advanced prostate cancer.

It is a disease that has never been far from his mind in the 10 years since his oldest son, Beau, died of brain cancer – leaving a deep emotional scar on the father that lingers to this day.

After that tragedy, finding a cure for cancer became a cause for the elder Biden.

In 2016, then-President Barack Obama tasked him with leading a ""moonshot"" government-wide research effort to that end - an effort that Biden continued during his own presidency.

Now it is cancer that presents possibly the greatest threat to Biden's health since he nearly died of a brain aneurism shortly after he abandoned his first presidential bid in 1988.

The news of the diagnosis lands as Democrats continue to grapple with the consequences of Biden's fateful decision to seek a second presidential term in the 2024 election – an attempt to extend the record he had already set for the oldest occupant of the Oval Office.

Biden ultimately dropped out of the race after intense pressure from Democrats following his halting, at times incomprehensible, performance in a general election debate with Donald Trump last June. But until that point, he had insisted that he was fit to continue in the White House for another four years.

This cancer diagnosis will underscore that the concerns about his age and the potential for health issues expressed by a majority of American voters in national polling were valid.

It coincides with the publication of several books detailing the efforts by those close to the president in the White House to accommodate, and conceal from the public, the toll the years were taking on his body and mind while he continued to serve as commander-in-chief.

While there is no reason to believe that Biden's prostate issues were at all apparent while he was in the White House, the fact that such an aggressive form of cancer could avoid detection until it had already spread, despite the wealth of medical support and evaluation available to Biden, will raise new questions and concerns.

It sets up a troubling hypothetical of how Biden's cancer might have been treated if he had successfully won a second term.

Hypotheticals notwithstanding, Biden's diagnosis may temper some of the sharper criticisms the book revelations would have otherwise prompted.

President Donald Trump, who had spent much of his recent trip to the Middle East disparaging his predecessor, released a statement extending his ""warmest and best wishes"" to the Biden family. That may be representative of the tenor of the public dialogue around Biden in the coming days.

Until several recent media interviews, including one with the BBC in which he defended his decision to stay in the 2024 race until a late stage, Biden had largely receded from public view since leaving power in January.

If the former president has the energy and endurance to do so, this latest medical revelation might give him a new platform, and a newly sympathetic public, to attempt to defend and burnish his presidential legacy.

Over the course of his public life, Joe Biden has defined himself by his persistence and endurance, only reaching the pinnacle of American power late in life.

His illness is another formidable challenge. But it presents one more opportunity for Biden to define himself – as a politician and as a man - by how he handles it.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62vg853n6qo,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z
BBC,UK driverless cars coming in 2027 - but Uber says it's ready now,"Uber has said it is ""ready to go"" now with driverless taxis in the UK - but the government has put back the date it expects to approve fully self-driving vehicles.

The previous administration said fully autonomous cars were ""set to be on roads by 2026"", but the new government says it is now more likely to happen in the second half of 2027.

While limited self-driving technology is already permitted on UK roads, a human driver must be at the wheel and responsible for the vehicle, even if automated technology is being used.

With some companies trialling more advanced tech on British streets, I took an automated car ride across central London in a car using a system developed by UK AI firm Wayve.

""We're ready to launch robotaxis in the UK as soon as the regulatory environment is ready for us,"" said Andrew Macdonald, senior vice president of mobility at Uber, who joined me for the ride.

The ride-hailing firm is working with 18 automated car tech companies including Wayve.

It is one of several companies which already offers robotaxis in the US.

They are also on the roads in China, the UAE and Singapore.

But Mr Macdonald disagreed that the UK was behind the rest of the world, arguing that the US and China were ahead largely because that is where the majority of the tech had been developed.

""We are working quickly and will implement self-driving vehicle legislation in the second half of 2027"", the Department for Transport said in a statement.

""We are also exploring options for short-term trials and pilots to create the right conditions for a thriving self-driving sector,"" it added.

In the US, Mr Macdonald said robotaxis typically operate for 20 hours per day, seven days per week.

Even though there is no driver to pay, Uber says the fare is currently the same as a ride with a human behind the wheel.

The option to take one appears on the app if one is available, and customers can opt in or out.

That's partly because, aside from the regulatory environment, another potential barrier to their uptake is the public's reticence about travelling in a self-driving vehicle.

A poll by YouGov in 2024 suggested that 37% of Brits would feel ""very unsafe"" travelling in a car without a driver.

But Mr Macdonald insisted new customers' initial nervousness was short-lived and the experience soon ""becomes the new normal"".

That was certainly my experience during our ride.

I was in a Ford Mach-e, fitted with Wayve's autonomous driving sensors and software.

It uses a radar and seven cameras. In the boot there's is a computer which is running the AI-driven software that processes all that sensor data in real time and controls the car's responses.

The automated tech handled every scenario without a hitch, including pedestrians in the road, parked cars, heavy traffic, temporary traffic lights and delivery bikes.

George, our safety driver, did not touch the controls once and a big red button, which shuts off the automated system immediately, was not deployed.

If anything the robo-ride was a far more patient city driver than I am – and has no voice, making it a lot less chatty.

Whether autonomous vehicles are more or less safe than human-driven ones is still being investigated.

But numerous studies suggest that automated vehicles are less accident-prone than human drivers, based on US data.

But there have been a number of incidents involving robotaxis in the countries where they operate, ranging from road accidents to passengers being locked in.

In January, a man in Arizona, in the US, documented how his robotaxi drove round in circles in an airport carpark, with him trapped in the vehicle, unable to stop the car or get help.

General Motors paused its driverless taxi service Cruise in San Francisco in 2023 because of safety concerns.

""The reality is that one accident is too many,"" said Uber's Mr Macdonald.

""That said, with EV (electric vehicles), human drivers… we operate in the real world and stuff happens.""

In the UK there are also practical questions around insurance, ownership and liability when a self-driving vehicle is involved in an accident. Mr Macdonald said they were all still being worked out.

Tom Leggett, vehicle technology manager at Thatcham Research - an independent car safety centre - said robotaxis would have to be ""safety-led"" in the UK.

""Secondly, they will have to make sure the data is available to those who need it – insurers and those investigating incidents when they occur.""

The government says self-driving vehicles have the potential ""to build an industry worth £42bn and provide 38,000 jobs by 2035.""

But of course they are source of concern for people who earn a living driving.

Andy Prendergast, GMB national secretary, said the ""significant social implications"" driverless cars and taxis could have - such as potential less work or unemployment - for workers and the public must be fully considered.

Uber's Mr Macdonald meanwhile believes automated vehicles will transform the way many people travel in the near future.

""I've got young kids,"" he said.

""Do I think my daughters will necessarily get their drivers licences when they turn 16?"" [the legal age in his home country, Canada].

""No – I think the world is changing a lot.""

BBC,Gary Lineker: A sorry end to a BBC career,"This is a sorry end to a long BBC career. Gary Lineker was among the corporation's highest-paid presenters for a reason - he is popular with audiences, knowledgeable and brilliant at his job.

But it's an understatement to suggest he has also caused problems for his BBC bosses over the years, as their high-profile football host began to morph into a presenter with opinions that he voiced on social media.

In the end, those two things were increasingly in conflict.

This has always been about reputation management for the BBC. Lineker had already, in the eyes of BBC bosses, caused the corporation damage with previous social media posts. Mistakenly sharing a video about Zionism which included a rat emoji was the final straw.

It was difficult to see how he could continue presenting for the corporation, particularly at a time when the BBC is enmeshed in another controversy surrounding a documentary about Gaza, which it pulled after discovering the child narrator was the son of a Hamas official.

I think what's different is that on this occasion, Lineker regrets his actions. He has appeared bullish about previous posts, saying that while he regretted damaging the BBC, he didn't believe, for example, that comparing the language of a Conservative asylum policy to that of 1930s Germany was wrong.

But last week he crossed the line.

Lineker is genuinely upset by what happened. He is mortified that he reposted the video. His relationship with the BBC is coming to an end in circumstances nobody would have wanted, but some might have predicted.

He seemed unable or unwilling to accept that his high profile might prevent him from voicing strongly-held views that many believed had an impact on the BBC's need for impartiality.

We live increasingly in an age when people want to express their opinions, and often do. Social media has given everyone a platform, and high-profile media figures have huge followings.

He could not keep quiet. In the end, it brought him down.

But he is a successful podcast entrepreneur, owning a third of the shares in Goalhanger, the company behind hit shows including The Rest is History and The Rest is Politics.

I would also not be surprised if he does appear in the future on TV, perhaps even as a presenter of the World Cup for another outlet.

He has shown contrition, but it has been a damaging few days.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq54wy9jzgdo,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z
BBC,BBC uncovers child sex abuse in South Africa's illegal mines,"This story contains details, including a video, that some people may find distressing.

The most shocking thing for Jonathan, who had endured six gruelling months living and working underground in an abandoned South African gold mine, was the abuse he witnessed being meted out to children.

Some are recruited for cheap labour, but others are brought in specifically for sex, campaigners say.

Jonathan, now in his late 20s, had migrated to South Africa from a nearby country on the promise of making easy money working in one of its dozens of disused mines, closed by multinationals because they were no longer commercially viable.

We are protecting his full identity as he fears reprisals from the vicious criminal gangs that run the illegal mining industry for speaking to the media.

Details of what the young people were going though emerged after the death of dozens of illegal miners near the town of Stilfontein late last year when the mine was blockaded by police.

In a calm and steady voice, Jonathan describes the heat, long hours and limited food and sleeping options which took a toll on his body.

But an enduring memory is what happened to the underage miners in the shaft where he worked.

""I used to see these kids in the mine - teenagers actually, 15, 17-year-olds.

""Others used to take advantage of them sometimes. It was a little bit scary, and I wasn't comfortable with it.""

He said they were raped by adult miners who promised to give them some of the gold they found in exchange for sex.

""If that kid is desperate for money, he will take the risk.""

Jonathan describes how the children would approach teams of miners for protection but ""that team would have conditions"".

Sex was also used as punishment if the teenagers failed to complete a task for their team.

Jonathan says the children in the mine where he worked were all foreign and did not realise what they were getting themselves into.

Mining researcher and activist Makhotla Sefuli backs this up.

He says criminal gangs specifically target children to work in illegal mines across South Africa.

Many of them are abducted from neighbouring countries and trafficked. They are enticed by baseless promises of finding them employment in the formal mining industry.

""Their passports are confiscated when they get to South Africa… It is common knowledge that these young boys are being abused,"" Mr Sefuli says.

The BBC has spoken to miners who worked in at least two other illegal mines who told us they saw children being abused in the shafts where they were working.

Tshepo, not his real name, says he saw older men forcing young boys to have sex with them underground.

""In some instances, they did it for the money. Some are recruited solely for that purpose, because of the financial incentives that will come with the practice of maybe trading sex underground.""

He adds that the abuse deeply affected the children.

""They change their behaviour patterns and have trust issues. They don't want you to get close to them, because they feel that they can no longer trust anyone.""

South Africa's illegal mining industry made global headlines last year following a standoff between police and miners at the Buffelsfontein gold mine, near the town of Stilfontein in the North West Province.

The authorities had been trying to curb illegal mining, which the government said cost South Africa's economy $3.2bn (£2.6bn) in lost revenue last year.

They launched an operation called Vala Umgodi, or seal the hole, in December 2023, promising to take a tough stance on the gangs.

As part of the operation, the police limited the amount of food and water that went down the Stilfontein mine to, as one minister put it, ""smoke out"" the illegal miners. Officials said the men were refusing to come out for fear of being arrested.

Soon footage began to emerge from within the mine showing dozens of emaciated men begging to be rescued, as well as rows of body bags. Eventually a court ordered the authorities to save the men.

Among those brought up were many who said they were underage, but as a number of them were migrants without documents confirming how old they were, the authorities carried out medical tests to get an estimate.

Through this, the Department of Social Development (DSD) confirmed that 31 of the rescued Stilfontein miners were found to be children. They were all Mozambicans nationals and in November, 27 of them were repatriated.

Save the Children South Africa helped translate some of the interviews between the underage miners and the rescue workers.

""They went through trauma, because some of them also saw others being sexually exploited,"" the charity's CEO Gugu Xaba tells the BBC.

""Just the feeling that they may not come out of there destroyed those children mentally.

""The adult miners would start by grooming them, by acting like they like them.""

She says the children were then made to perform sexual acts on the adults and they were then raped, days after day.

""You find that the adult will have three or four of them that they are doing the same thing to.""



Ms Xaba says mining gangs recruit children because they are easier to manipulate and cheaper.

""Children don't understand when you say: 'I'll pay you 20 rands ($1; £0.80) per day.' The adults sometimes refuse to work, but children find themselves with no choice. So it's easier to use a child to do the work. It's easier to take a child who's kind of voiceless and to bring them down there.""

Beyond being exploited financially, she says there are gangs that recruit children specifically for sex.

Many illegal miners spend months underground, rarely going up to the surface. Markets spring up underground to provide them with anything they need.

""Most children are trafficked in order to be used as sex slaves. And you've got a pimp who is taking the money, and it means every day this child is used as a commercial sex worker.""

The BBC asked the police and the DSD whether anyone would be charged over the sexual abuse allegations. They did not respond to our requests.

A source working on the Stilfontein miners' cases said many of the children did not want to testify.

Meanwhile, the illegal mining industry continues to thrive.

And with an estimated 6,000 vacant mines potentially available to explore, it is a business that is unlikely to end anytime soon, leaving thousands of vulnerable children at risk.

BBC,Israel orders Khan Younis evacuation ahead of 'unprecedented attack',"The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has ordered residents of Khan Younis to evacuate as it prepares to launch an ""unprecedented attack"".

People were ordered to move towards al-Mawasi in the west of the strip, in one of the largest evacuation orders issued by the Israeli military in recent months.

An Arabic statement shared by IDF spokesperson Avichay Adraee said the area ""will be considered a dangerous combat zone"", adding: ""Terrorist organizations have brought you disaster. For your safety, evacuate immediately.""

The IDF launched a major new Gaza offensive on Saturday named Operation Gideon's Chariots. Hospitals have said more than 100 people have been killed in the last 24 hours.

One woman from Khan Younis told BBC News that the new evacuation order - which also covers the areas of Bani Suhaila and Abasan - was her ""worst nightmare"".

Another woman, who is already living under an evacuation order in central Gaza, said she would not move ""because there is no place to go"".

The IDF said its aim was to ""destroy the capabilities of terrorist organizations in this area"".

Earlier on Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel would ""take control"" of the whole of Gaza.

In a video posted on social media, he said: ""We are engaged in massive fighting - intense and substantial - and there is progress.

""We are going to take control of all areas of the Strip, that's what we're going to do.""

The IDF said it had struck 160 targets across the strip in the last 24 hours.

A warehouse containing medical supplies at the Nasser Hospital was hit by an Israeli strike overnight, Gaza's Hamas-run ministry of health reported.

British charity Medical Aid for Palestinians said the strike happened ""as Palestinians who were killed and wounded from other attacks were being brought to the hospital"".

""We are just seeing all our work being burned to ashes,"" a spokesman for the charity said.

Separately, Palestinian media reported that Israeli special forces troops dressed in women's clothing had entered a Khan Younis home undercover and killed one man on Monday morning, before arresting his wife and child.

Israeli media named him as Ahmad Sarhan, and reported he was a senior member of the military wing of the Popular Resistance Committees - a Palestinian militant group aligned with Hamas.

The IDF has previously said the expanded Gaza operations are aimed at ""achieving all the war's objectives"", including releasing hostages and ""the defeat of Hamas"".

But a group representing many of the hostage's families said the operation posed ""grave and escalating dangers"" to hostages still held in Gaza.

""Testimonies from released hostages describe significantly worsened treatment following military strikes, including physical abuse, restraint and reduced food,"" the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said.

On Sunday, Israel announced it would allow a ""basic amount of food"" to enter Gaza to ensure that ""no starvation crisis develops"" after blockading the territory for 10 weeks.

The war was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, which saw about 1,200 people killed and 251 taken hostage.

Some 58 hostages remain in Gaza, up to 23 of whom are believed to be alive.

More than 53,000 Palestinians have been killed during Israel's military campaign in Gaza.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyrqg6j4y8o,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z
BBC,Liberal mayor Dan beats nationalist in tense race for Romanian presidency,"The liberal, pro-EU mayor of Bucharest, Nicusor Dan, has fought off a strong  challenge from a Romanian right-wing nationalist to win the presidency after months of political turbulence.

George Simion, the leader of the far-right AUR party, won a dramatic first-round victory earlier this month, riding a wave of anger from Romanians who had seen the presidential race annulled late last year because of claims of Russian interference.

But it was the softly spoken Nicusor Dan who swept to victory with 53.6% of the vote, even though Simion was more successful in the diaspora.

""We need to build Romania together irrespective of who you voted for,"" said Dan, once his victory was secure.

About 11.5 million Romanians voted in Sunday's run-off, and Dan attracted the support of more than six million of them.

The mathematician waited until after midnight on Sunday before he could be absolutely sure that the numbers were on his side and he could join his supporters in a park opposite City Hall in Bucharest.

They went wild, chanting his name and cheering. At one point he was almost mobbed but this was a huge moment for the president-elect and for his supporters after months of political tension.

""A community of Romanians who want a profound change in Romania won,"" Dan said.

Mihai, one of many Dan supporters who gathered outside his electoral headquarters in the capital, told the BBC he was ""really worried about Simion"".

""I want to choose the pro-European way. It's the only way. It's really important,"" he added.

Andrea, who came with her young daughter, told the BBC: ""We are so happy, we wanted to be here with other supporters of Nicosur.

""This means a better future for our children, for us. A good life for all of us, and an honest Romania.""

Romanians are broadly unhappy with the dominance of mainstream parties and the turbulence in this European Union and Nato member state intensified earlier this month when the government collapsed because its candidate had failed to make the second round.

While Nicusor Dan campaigned on fighting corruption and maintaining support for north-eastern neighbour Ukraine, Simion attacked the EU and called for cutting aid to Kyiv.

""Russia, don't forget, Romania isn't yours,"" Dan's supporters chanted.

Even though exit polls had given him victory, they did not include the all-important diaspora vote and Simion clung to the belief that he could still win.

""I won, I am the new president of Romania and I am giving back power to the Romanians,"" he insisted initially.

It was not until the early hours of Monday that he conceded victory on Facebook. A protest planned by his supporters was then apparently called off.

During the election campaign Simion had stood side by side with Calin Georgescu, the far-right fringe figure who had stunned Romania with a first-round presidential victory at the end of last year, buoyed by an enormous TikTok campaign.

The vote was annulled over allegations of campaign fraud and Russian interference and Georgescu was barred from running again. Russia denied any involvement.

Asked by the BBC on Sunday whether he was acting as Georgescu's puppet, George Simion said: ""The puppets are those who annulled the elections... I am a man of my people and my people voted for Calin Georgescu.

""Do we like democracy only when the good guy has won? I don't think this is an option.""

He said he was a patriot and accused what he called the mainstream media of smearing him as a pro-Russian or fascist.

The key to Simion's success in the first round was his extraordinary win among diaspora voters in Western Europe, including in the UK.

His supporters turned out in force again on Sunday, with partial results giving him 68.5% support in Spain, 66.8% in Italy and 67% in Germany. He also had the edge in the UK, where voters said they would have picked Calin Georgescu if authorities had not barred him from running.

""We didn't know anything about [Georgescu] but then I listened to what he was saying, and you can tell he's a good Christian,"" said 37-year-old Catalina Grancea.

She had vowed to go back to Romania if Simion had won and her mother Maria said she too had voted for change: ""Our children were forced to leave Romania because they couldn't find any jobs there.""

However, Nicusor Dan's voters came out in even bigger numbers both in Romania and abroad. In neighbouring Moldova 87% of Romanians backed the mayor of Bucharest.

The presidents of both Moldova and Ukraine congratulated him on his victory.

""Moldova and Romania stand together, supporting one another and working side by side for a peaceful, democratic, and European future for all our citizens,"" said Maia Sandu.

""For Ukraine, as a neighbour and friend, it is important to have Romania as a reliable partner,"" said Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on social media that Romanians had turned out in massive numbers and had ""chosen the promise of an open, prosperous Romania in a strong Europe"".

In the end this was an emphatic ""No"" vote to a staunch nationalist with an isolationist vision for Romania, a known provocateur and a man whose commitment to EU membership and to the bloc's core values was not clear.

Despite his strong showing in round one, those Romanians who worried about what he stood for appear to have rallied to block him from power.

But Simion did win a significant chunk of the vote, and his message will still resonate with many.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crk2xxzxkzxo,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z
BBC,Warsaw's liberal mayor narrowly wins Polish presidential vote,"Warsaw's liberal mayor Rafal Trzaskowski won a narrow victory in Poland's presidential election, but a second-round run-off with conservative historian Karol Nawrocki will be required to decide the country's next president.

The state electoral commission (PKW) said Trzaskowski, a deputy leader of prime minister Donald Tusk's centrist Civic Platform (PO) party, won 31.3% of the vote.

Nawrocki came second with 29.5% of the vote.

Final official results are not expected until later on Monday. Turnout was over 67%.

Trzaskowski and Nawrocki are now set to compete in a second-round on 1 June as none of the 13 candidates won more than 50% of the vote.

Trzaskowski told his supporters at a rally in Sandomierz, southern Poland: ""We're going to win."" But he said a lot of work and ""great determination"" would be needed.

""I'm convinced that all Poland will win,"" he said.

He pledged to cooperate with prime minister Tusk's coalition to liberalise the country's strict abortion law and accelerate reform of the Polish judiciary, which was widely seen to have been politicised by the previous PiS-led government.

Trzaskowski performed worse than opinion polls predicted before the vote, which had him between 4%-6% ahead of Nawrocki.

Poland's president has largely ceremonial powers but he or she is able to veto government legislation. Tusk's coalition does not have a big enough parliamentary majority to overturn a presidential veto.

Tusk has failed to deliver many of his campaign promises, partly because the incumbent conservative president Andrzej Duda has vetoed his government's legislation, but also due to divisions within the coalition over issues like abortion and civil partnerships.

A victory for Trzaskowski would remove the president's veto, but Nawrocki would likely be an even tougher obstacle than Duda.

Nawrocki told his supporters in Gdansk that Tusk must be stopped from winning total power in Poland.

He called on supporters of two far-right candidates, Slawomir Mentzen, who came third and won 14.8%, and of Grzegorz Braun, who came fourth and won 6.3%, to ""save Poland"" from Tusk.

A lot will depend on which candidate can mobilise their electorate in the second round.

Nawrocki was unknown on a national scale before Law and Justice (PiS) chose him as its candidate. But he has improved on the job, and PiS is traditionally good at getting their vote out.

Trzaskowski will need to win the votes of supporters of his centrist party, but also those supporting the candidates of the junior coalition partners, the Left (Magdalena Biejat) and conservative Third Way (Szymon Holownia).

Another worry for Trzaskowski is the better than expected result of far-right candidates because many of their supporters will not vote for him.

Mentzen's result was a strong showing and continued the improvement of his far-right Confederation party since it entered parliament in 2019.

Who will his, mainly young voters, back in the run-off?

Many would support Nawrocki for his Catholic, family-oriented views, but they dislike PiS's left-wing economic policy of generous state benefits.

Mentzen is an anti-establishment candidate, and some of his supporters may not want to vote for either Nawrocki or Trzaskowski, who represent the two parties that have dominated Polish politics for two decades.

Far-right MEP Grzegorz Braun's result was a nasty surprise for Poland's liberal voters.

Braun made headlines in 2023 when he put out the candles on a Jewish menorah in the Polish parliament with a fire extinguisher following a ceremony for the festival of Hanukkah.

Braun called the festival ""satanic"". During a presidential debate last month he said: ""Jews have far too much say in Polish affairs.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgegn1ggxn8o,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z
BBC,Water voles are almost extinct - could glitter save them?,"Endangered water voles in Wales are being fed edible glitter in a bid to save them from extinction.

Once commonly found across south Wales, water voles are now effectively extinct in all but a few locations, according to the Wildlife Trust.

With their future hanging in the balance, conservationists have been looking for new ways to track the naturally shy individuals in the wild - which is where the glitter comes in.

The Initiative for Nature Conservation Cymru (INCC) hopes that by offering the animals something sparkly to eat, the sparkle should come out the other end - providing some much-needed answers.

Rob Parry, chief executive of INCC, said his team had consulted with vets to ensure the edible and biodegradable glitter - the type used to decorate cakes - would not be harmful to the semi-aquatic creatures.

""It's something that we've done in nature conservation before for other species, for badgers in particular where we use pellets to put in with peanuts, which badgers love,"" said Mr Parry.

""So we've taken that idea and scaled it down to water vole size, which means using glitter.""

The hope is that if the water voles are willing to consume the glitter then it will come out in their poo, allowing the small mammals - which are often mistaken for brown rats - to be tracked by conservationists.

Different colours of glitter could be used to allow conservationists to track different families of water voles and how far they range.

It might sound like a fun idea, but Mr Parry and his team could not be more serious.

If they can track where water voles are located in the wild, they can make adjustments to the environment - like removing invasive conifers from wetland habitats or fencing off certain riverbanks to stop sheep grazing.

Measures like this could help the species to disperse through the landscape undisturbed and potentially be a life-saving intervention.

""We'll be able to see the types of territory, the size and where they go in,"" said Mr Parry.

""Are they just using the linear features, the ditches, or are they spreading out into the bog and the molinia grassland habitat?

""That will be really crucial for when it comes to planning for our upland habitats.""

The team is first testing out their theory on some captive-bred water voles which are part of a wider Natural Resources Wales (NRW)  project to reintroduce colonies into the wild.

The glitter is spread onto chunks of apple, not part of their normal diet in the wild, but a food the animals love and do well on in captivity, according to Richard Davies from NRW.

""They get everything they need from apples, carrots, and some dried rabbit food as well,"" he said.

He has successfully bred hundreds of water voles which have been reintroduced into the wild, though he said their release was no guarantee of survival.

""Most predators in the UK would quite happily take a water vole. They need to be able to cope with this heavy predation and replace themselves a lot,"" he said.

With a BBC News camera present, the glittery purple apple was placed on top of the straw bedding which covered the water voles' pen.

After 20 minutes, the food remained untouched, but an hour later most of it had disappeared.

The success of the project, however, does not just depend on the appetite of the water voles, but how well the glitter can retain its shine from end to end.

Mr Parry said without interventions like this, the future for water voles was uncertain.

""It's been a perfect storm of bad things that's happened to water voles in the last few decades,"" he said.

""We have drained an awful lot of their wetland habitat, forced them into linear ditches where we find them now, and then the biggest problem is the American mink, an invasive species that was let out and released from pens and they just turned out to be the perfect water vole predators. The water voles don't stand a chance, really.""

But now, at least, he is more hopeful.

The water voles, known for being nervous about any changes to to their environment, had not rejected the glitter.

So, did the experiment work?

Just 24 hours later, a tiny glittery poo was spotted.

The conservation team was elated.

BBC,FBI says suspect in California blast targeted fertility clinic,"The man accused of setting off a car blast outside a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, is said to be a 25-year-old with ""nihilistic ideations"".

Guy Edward Bartkus, who is thought to have died in the blast, left behind writings which suggest he disapproved of people being brought into the world against their will, law enforcement sources told CBS News.

He detonated explosives outside the clinic on Saturday morning and tried to livestream the attack, said investigators.

Four other people were injured in the explosion and have been released from hospital. None of the wounded are staff or patients at the clinic.

""The subject had nihilistic ideations and this was a targeted attack,"" said Akil Davis, assistant director in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles field office.

The FBI is reviewing a manifesto they believe is linked to Bartkus, who lived at  Twentynine Palms, home to a large marine base.

He loaded his 2010 silver Ford Fusion sedan with explosives before driving an hour from Twentynine Palms to Palm Springs, investigators said.

His father told CBS News Los Angeles that he had not spoken to his son in more than 10 years and that he had ""just changed"" after moving to Twentynine Palms.

Mr Davis said the FBI is still looking for the public's help to piece together the suspect's whereabouts before the blast, and will remain on scene for the next day or two to continue their investigation.

The blast was felt more than a mile away. Mr Davis referred to it as ""the largest bombing scene"" the FBI had seen in southern California in recent memory, and said police are working to survey evidence that is scattered 100 feet away from the explosion ""in every direction"".

Several buildings were damaged in the blast, including the ACR fertility clinic with images showing a portion of its wall destroyed.

The fertility clinic said their lab, including all eggs and embryos, remained ""fully secure and undamaged"".

But Dr Maher Abdallah, who runs the clinic, told the Associated Press that the clinic's office was damaged.

""I really have no clue what happened,"" he said. ""Thank God today happened to be a day that we have no patients.""

According to its website, the ARC clinic is the first full-service fertility centre and IVF lab in the Coachella Valley.

It offers services including fertility evaluations, IVF, egg donation and freezing, reproductive support for same-sex couples and surrogacy.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c787j90wp6po,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z
BBC,The world's most dangerous country for trade unionists,"In July last year, Jesús Cometa was shot at as he was driving through the Cauca Valley in southwest Colombia.

Gunmen on motorbikes pulled up alongside his car and sprayed it with bullets. Mr Cometa escaped uninjured but his bodyguard was hit.

""He still has a bullet lodged in his chest,"" he says.

Mr Cometa is one of thousands of trade unionists who have been attacked in recent years in Colombia which, by some measurements, is the most dangerous place in the world for organised labour.

The Cauca Valley is home to the country's sugar industry, and he is a local representative of Sintrainagro, Colombia's largest agricultural trade union.

""When you take on these roles in the union, you lose your social life,"" Mr Cometa says. ""You can't just go and hang out in a crowded bar, or on a street corner, because you never know when you might be targeted.

""Your family suffers too because they know that they're also targets.""

This is a problem with a long history.

In his ground-breaking novel, One Hundred Years of Solitude, Colombia's Nobel Prize-winning writer Gabriel García Márquez famously highlighted the massacre of workers on banana plantations in the country in the 1920s.

The Labour Ministry says that since the early 1970s, well over 3,000 trade unionists have been murdered in Colombia.

And even though the nation is more peaceful than it once was, the attacks continue.

""For many years now already, unfortunately, Colombia is the deadliest country in the world for trade unionists and for trade union work,"" says Luc Triangle, general secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC), a global umbrella organization based in Brussels.

Every year the ITUC publishes a survey of the atrocities carried out against trade unionists around the world. Its most recent edition covers the year to the end of March 2024.

It found that in those 12 months, 22 trade unionists were killed for their activism around the world. Eleven of them were murdered in Colombia.

""Generally, these are targeted murders,"" Mr Triangle says. ""They know what they are doing. They know who they want to murder.

""It's not targeting the big bosses of the trade unions or the leaders. They are targeting in small villages people that are doing active trade union work.

""Between 2020 and 2023, we recorded 45 murders in Colombia. In 2022, 29 murders. It's less violent than it once was, but it's still very violent, certainly if you compare it with other countries.""

Why is this happening?

Fabio Arias, the head of Colombia's largest trade union federation, the CUT, says it is all part of Colombia's long and complex civil conflict, which pitted left-wing rebel groups against right-wing paramilitaries, drug traffickers and the Colombian state, and which still rumbles on in some parts of the country.

""The trade union movement has always been linked to the parties of the left and unfortunately the many right-wing governments we've had in Colombia have always claimed that anyone who is a leftist is a guerrilla, a terrorist,"" Mr Arias says.

""And once you've established that, then people feel justified in attacking them.""

He says the attacks on workers are also linked to Colombia's illegal economies, notably the cocaine trade and illegal mining.

""If you look at where these attacks are happening, it's in the departments of Cauca, Nariño, Putumayo, Arauca, Norte de Santander and Caquetá, because that's where the biggest coca plantations are, and where the illegal mining is.""

It is not clear who is carrying out these killings and who is ordering them. Some trade unionists blame the private sector, saying businesses, desperate to stifle any attempt by workers to organize, are paying armed groups to carry out these atrocities.

They point to the fact that threats and attacks tend to spike at times when businesses and unions are in wage negotiations.

But as many of the attacks go unpunished, it is difficult to know who exactly is to blame.

""In the Cauca Valley there are so many different armed groups you never really know who's behind the attacks, who's carrying them out, who's ordering them,"" says Zenón Escobar, another sugar cane worker and local representative of Sintrainagro.

The threats in the Cauca Valley are not limited to the sugar industry.

""In 2007, I was in a van, and guys drew up next to us on a motorbike and asked for me, and then opened fire,"" recalls Jimmy Núñez, the leader of a union that represents street traders in the regional capital Cali.

""My colleague who was sitting next to me was killed, and my wife was injured. In 2010 they attacked me again, on the road between Cauca and Cali.

""They opened fire on my car. In 2012 we were attacked in a shopping centre in Cali and one of us was killed. And in 2013 my family had to leave Cauca due to threats.

""In this country social leaders and trade union leaders are killed every day.""

The government says it is doing what it can to protect trade unionists. Colombia's president, Gustavo Petro, heads a left-wing administration that is broadly sympathetic to the country's workers.

In 2023, it took a step towards redressing the past by formally recognizing the trade union movement – collectively, and for the first time – as a victim of Colombia's conflict. That gives victims a greater chance of having their cases investigated.

""We consider this as an important step to recognize the violence against trade unionists in Colombia, which was not the case before,"" says Luc Triangle of the ITUC.

He also says foreign companies with operations in Colombia must do more.

""If I were the CEO of a multinational, I would question my activities in Colombia,"" he says.

""There is a huge responsibility for multinational companies. They cannot have a nice code of conduct, and at the same time remain silent when trade unionists are killed.

""That's not acceptable. Global companies and foreign investors in Colombia must step up.""

BBC,South Africa to pursue appeal against Nigerian pastor acquitted of rape,"South African authorities say they will continue with legal proceedings against Nigerian televangelist Timothy Omotoso who was acquitted of rape last month, even though he has left the country.

Mr Omotoso, who denied the 32 charges against him, was accused of sexually assaulting young women from his church in Port Elizabeth.

The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) says it will still appeal against the judgement which found Mr Omotoso not guilty, saying his presence is not required.

South Africa's Department of Home Affairs said Mr Omotoso had flown to Nigeria from OR Tambo International Airport, where he was filmed by public broadcaster SABC wearing a hoodie and dark sunglasses.

Mr Omotoso was first arrested in 2017 as he attempted to leave South Africa.

Among his accusers was a woman who said she was raped by the pastor when she was aged 14.

In a statement, South African prosecutors accepted ""there are no legal grounds to prevent"" Mr Omotoso from leaving the country following his acquittal.

However, if the appeal were allowed, the authorities would apply for Mr Omotoso to be extradited back to South Africa, the statement added, highlighting South Africa's ""bilateral extradition treaty with Nigeria"".

After his acquittal in April, Mr Omotoso also faced immigration issues, with the Department of Home Affairs alleging earlier this month that he was in South Africa illegally.

On Sunday, the department issued a statement saying that Mr Omotoso had been classified as an ""undesirable person"", meaning he will not be able to return to the country for five years.

South Africa's public broadcaster reports that the pastor left the country voluntarily.

Mr Omotoso leads the Jesus Dominion International church which has branches in the UK, Nigeria, France and Israel as well as in many parts of South Africa, according to its website.

Mr Omotoso's trial made South African history as the first high-profile rape case to be broadcast live.

BBC,What we know about Biden's prostate cancer diagnosis,"Former US President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones.

Biden received the news on Friday after he saw a doctor last week for urinary symptoms.

Here's what you need to know about prostate cancer and its treatment options.

Prostate cancer affects tissue of the prostate gland, the part of the male reproductive system that helps make semen. It is located between the penis and the bladder.

According to the NHS, it usually develops slowly, meaning some live for decades without symptoms or needing treatment.

In Biden's case, the cancer is aggressive, and his family are said to be reviewing options for treatment.

Biden was diagnosed following urinary symptoms, one of the most common signs of prostate cancer. That's because it is often detected only when the prostate is big enough to have impacted the urethra, the tube that connects the bladder to the penis.

Those symptoms can include needing to urinate more frequently, as well as a slow or weak urinary stream.

Screening for prostate cancer is part of routine presidential health inspections, according to Dr Jeffrey Kuhlman, former White House doctor under President Barack Obama.

Prostate cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer death in American men, according to the American Cancer Society, behind lung cancer.

There will be more than 300,000 new cases in the US this year, according to projections by the American Cancer Society. About one in 8 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during their lifetime.

While it is ""not uncommon"" for men in their 80s to be diagnosed with prostate cancer, the grade and stage of Biden's cancer are ""more advanced than most men would encounter"" at diagnosis, Dr Ryan Cleary, urologist at MedStar Health, told the BBC.

The former president's prostate cancer is ""characterised by a Gleason score of 9"", his office said in the statement announcing his diagnosis.

In the US, the Gleason score is a common way of grading the capacity for cells from the primary tumour to spread round the body - also known as metastatic cancer.

Specifically, it refers to how abnormal the cancer cells look in a sample under a microscope. The scale runs from six to 10, with a higher number indicating a more aggressive cancer.

The scale starts at six because it is calculated by combining the two most common patterns of cancer cells found in a patient. The lowest score assigned to cancerous cells is three. That's why the lowest Gleason score for a cancer diagnosis is six.

A Gleason score of nine, such as Biden's, means it is a ""high-grade cancer"". Cancer cells with a score of nine look very abnormal and are likely to grow quickly.

Biden's cancer is aggressive in nature and has already spread to his bones.

According to Dr Jamin Vinod Brahmbhatt, a urologist at Orlando Health Medical Group, this level of spread does limit the treatment options.

While there are medical based treatments such as chemotherapy, steroids and hormone therapy available, none of them are ""curative"", he said.

""There are more medical options to stabilise the patient and control the cancer, but it never gets rid of the cancer completely.""

Biden's cancer is also said to be hormone sensitive, which means the cancer uses hormones to grow or develop.

These types of cancers can be managed by drugs that block or lower the amount of hormones in the body.

Dr Brahmbhatt said while this ""opens up the toolkit"" of treatment options for Biden, it was going to take ""weeks or months"" to see how he responds.

Dr Kuhlman said Biden could also have the option of entering ""clinical trials for advanced disease"" if he meets the inclusion criteria.

Biden and his family are said to be reviewing treatment options.

In Sunday's statement, Biden's office said since the cancer appeared to be hormone-sensitive, that ""allows for effective management"".

The full details of Biden's case are not known. Dr Cleary said: ""Generally, about a third of patients will still be alive after five years of metastatic prostate cancer.""

However, advanced stages of prostate cancer can limit a person's lifespan and lead to symptoms that make daily life harder.

Dr Kuhlman said it was important to consider treatments that maintain Biden's quality of life in the next few years.

""If there's any inspiration in this, it is to go and get yourself checked out whether you have symptoms or not,"" Dr Brahmbhatt said.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2e7vrqyyyo,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z

CNA,WHO chief urges countries to adopt pandemic agreement,"GENEVA: The head of the World Health Organisation (WHO) on Monday (May 19) urged countries to adopt this week the Pandemic Agreement, aimed at preventing a repeat of the COVID-19 crisis.

WHO member states are holding their annual World Health Assembly, a gathering of the UN health agency's decision-making body.

""At this assembly, member states will consider, and hopefully adopt, the WHO Pandemic Agreement,"" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in his opening address to the gathering in Geneva.

""This is truly a historic moment.""

After more than three years of negotiations, the text of the agreement was finalised by consensus last month.

The United States pulled out of the talks, following US President Donald Trump's decision to trigger the country's one-year withdrawal process to leave the WHO.

""Even in the middle of crisis, and in the face of significant opposition, you worked tirelessly, you never gave up, and you reached your goal,"" said Tedros.

The hard-fought consensus spurred ""joy, triumph, relief, exhaustion,"" he said.

""I look forward to your adoption of the agreement.""

The agreement on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response is expected to be adopted by the assembly on Tuesday.

It aims to better detect and combat pandemics by focusing on greater international coordination and surveillance, and more equitable access to vaccines and treatments.

The negotiations grew tense amid disagreements between wealthy and developing countries, with the latter feeling cut off from access to vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The agreement faced opposition from those who thought it would encroach on state sovereignty.

Countries have until May 2026 to thrash out the details of the agreement's Pathogen Access and Benefit-Sharing (PABS) mechanism.

The PABS mechanism deals with sharing access to pathogens with pandemic potential, and the sharing of benefits derived from them: vaccines, tests and treatments.

Once the PABS system is finalised, the agreement can then be ratified. Sixty ratifications are required for the treaty to enter into force.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/who-chief-urges-countries-adopt-pandemic-agreement-5139706,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z
CNA,Italy's data watchdog fines AI company Replika's developer $5.6 million,"MILAN :Italy's data protection agency has fined the developer of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot company Replika 5 million euros ($5.64 million) for breaching rules designed to protect users' personal data, the authority said on Monday.

Launched in 2017, San Francisco-based startup Replika offers users customised avatars that can have conversations with them. The 'virtual friend' is marketed as being able to improve the emotional wellbeing of users.

Italian privacy watchdog Garante ordered Replika to suspend its service in the country in February 2023, citing specific risks to children.

Following an investigation, it found that Replika lacked a legal basis for processing users' data and had no age-verification system to restrict children from accessing the service, resulting in the fine for its developer, Luka Inc.



Replika did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The Italian authority has also announced a separate investigation to assess whether Replika's generative AI system is compliant with European Union privacy rules, especially around the training of its language model.

Garante is one of the European Union's most proactive regulators in assessing AI-platform compliance with the bloc's data privacy rules.

Last year, it fined ChatGPT maker OpenAI 15 million euros after briefly banning the use of the popular chatbot in Italy in 2023 over the alleged breach of EU privacy rules.

CNA,Taiwan coast guard says 'urgent need' for surveillance tech,"TAIPEI: Taiwan's coast guard said on Monday (May 19) there was an ""urgent need"" for infrared thermal imaging and other technology to detect small boats off the island after it detained two Chinese nationals.

A Chinese father and son were picked up after arriving on a beach near Taipei on Friday, days before Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te celebrates his first year in office.

The pair had travelled undetected by motorised inflatable boat from China's Fujian province, the coast guard said.

""Such boats are not easily detected by radar and the personnel responsible for coastal patrol were patrolling other areas at the time,"" coast guard spokesman Hsieh Ching-chin told reporters.



""There is an urgent need to enhance patrol capabilities using technological support to prevent further undetected illegal entries,"" he said.

There had been five cases involving 38 individuals from China and Vietnam caught illegally entering Taiwan since January, the coast guard said.

Hsieh said the coast guard hoped to receive funding from a special budget for infrared thermal imaging equipment as well as drones and artificial intelligence warning systems ""to effectively respond to China's increasingly severe grey-zone harassment"", Hsieh said.

Infrared thermal imagers had been deployed on Kinmen, an outlying archipelago administered by Taiwan, and other places where ""landings have happened before"".

However, a round-the-clock coastal surveillance system ""with no blind spots"" would require ""substantial funding"", he said.

Beijing claims Taiwan as part of its territory and has threatened to use force to bring it under its control.

Taiwan accuses China of using ""grey-zone"" tactics – actions that fall short of an act of war – to weaken its defences.

Hsieh said more Chinese people were arriving illegally on Taiwan's main island than in the past and that it could be part of China's ""cognitive warfare"".

It was possible Beijing would ""again use similar tactics"" to ""disrupt public morale"" as Lai marks the first anniversary of his inauguration on Tuesday, Hsieh said.

CNA,AMD to sell ZT Systems' server-manufacturing business to Sanmina in $3 billion deal,"AMD has agreed to sell the server-manufacturing business of recently acquired ZT Systems to Sanmina in a $3 billion deal, making the contract manufacturer its partner for building AI systems as the chipmaker works to onshore supply chains.

AMD had announced a $4.9 billion buyout of ZT Systems last year and unveiled plans to break off its server manufacturing business and sell it once the transaction closes. The deal was completed in March.

Under the agreement announced on Monday, AMD will retain ZT's AI systems design businesses and will work with Sanmina as a U.S.-based manufacturing partner for its AI data center business. Shares of AMD were down 2.7 per cent in premarket trading.

""We expect to strengthen our U.S.-based manufacturing capabilities for rack and cluster-scale AI systems and accelerate quality and time-to-market for our cloud customers,"" Forrest Norrod, executive vice president of AMD's data center solutions business unit, said in a statement.



AMD has already taken steps to produce more of its chips on American soil amid global trade tensions and U.S. President Donald Trump's efforts to expand domestic semiconductor manufacturing.

The company had said last month its key processor chips would soon be made at TSMC's new production site in Arizona — the first time its products will be manufactured in the United States.

Sanmina will pay $2.25 billion in cash for ZT Systems' data center infrastructure manufacturing business, along with $300 million premium consisting of 50 per cent cash and 50 per cent equity.

The deal, expected to close near the end of this year, also includes a $450 million contingent consideration based on financial performance of the business over the next three years.

CNA,"Qorvo nominates Starboard's Peter Feld to board, ends boardroom battle","Chipmaker Qorvo said on Monday it will nominate activist investor Starboard Value's managing member Peter Feld to its board, ending a boardroom battle as the Apple supplier's stock shows signs of recovery.

Stiff competition and a shift in demand towards entry-tier smartphones pushed Qorvo shares down about 38 per cent last year.  However, the possibility of winning additional chip contracts with major customer Apple has sent shares up more than 10 per cent this year.

In April, Starboard said it delivered a letter to Qorvo, nominating Feld for election to the board and increased its stake in the company to about 8.9 per cent.

This holding is valued at over $600 million, based on Qorvo's market capitalization of about $7.44 billion at the previous close.



Feld is a managing member, portfolio manager, and head of research at Starboard.

Earlier in April, Qorvo appointed former NXP Semiconductors CEO Richard Clemmer and Marvell Technology COO Christopher Koopmans as independent directors.

Starboard's stake in the chipmaker was first disclosed in a filing in January, at about 7.7 per cent then, estimated to be worth over $500 million at that time.

The Jeffrey Smith-led hedge fund is one of the world's most prominent activist investors and has pushed for changes at firms including Pfizer and Salesforce.

Mr Low, 34, contested in Jalan Kayu Single Member Constituency, which saw the closest fight in the 2025 General Election. He received the highest percentage of votes among the unelected opposition candidates.

Ms Chong, 33, contested in Tampines Group Representation Constituency (GRC) as part of the WP's five-member team, which received the second-highest percentage of votes among the unelected opposition candidates.

NCMP seats are typically offered to the best-performing losing opposition candidates if the number of elected opposition candidates falls short of 12.

With the WP successfully defending its 10 parliamentary seats – namely the five-member Aljunied GRC, four-member Sengkang GRC and single-seat constituency Hougang – two seats became available for NCMPs.

In a media release on Monday, the Elections Department Singapore said that the returning officer wrote to WP candidates for Tampines GRC on May 9 and asked the group to determine among themselves by May 19 the candidate to be declared elected as NCMP.

It added that WP members informed the returning officer on May 18 of their decision to nominate Ms Chong as the candidate to be declared elected as NCMP.

WP said in a statement on Monday that it welcomes Mr Low and Ms Chong's contributions in parliament.

""The Workers’ Party remains steadfast in our mission of working for Singapore, and all WP Members of Parliament will carry forward the Workers’ Party’s longstanding mission to represent the interests of all Singaporeans, hold the government to account, and advance reasoned, principled debate in parliament,"" it added.

Both Ms Chong and Mr Low contested in the General Election for the first time.

Mr Low lost to labour chief Ng Chee Meng, 56, with 48.53 per cent of the vote.

The WP team in Tampines GRC garnered 47.37 per cent of the vote, losing to a PAP team led by Cabinet Minister Masagos Zulkifli in a four-cornered fight.

The WP team, led by party vice-chair Faisal Manap, comprised four newcomers, including Mr Jimmy Tan, Dr Ong Lue Ping and Mr Michael Thng.

In 2016, changes were made to the NCMP scheme, increasing the minimum number of opposition MPs in parliament from nine to 12.

CNA,Markets drop after US loses last triple-A credit rating,"HONG KONG: Stocks fell with the dollar on Monday (May 19) after Moody's removed the United States' last gold standard sovereign bond rating, citing the growing debt pile that it warned could balloon further.

The move dealt a blow to markets, which had enjoyed a healthy run-up last week after Washington and China hammered out a deal to temporarily slash tit-for-tat tariffs.

After the rout sparked by Donald Trump's Liberation Day tariffs bazooka, investors have in recent weeks raced back to buy up beaten-down stocks as the White House tempered its hardball tariff approach.

But selling returned on Monday after Moody's cut its rating on US debt to Aa1 from Aaa, noting ""the increase over more than a decade in government debt and interest payment ratios to levels that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns"".



It added that it expected federal deficits to widen to almost 9 per cent of economic output by 2035, from 6.4 per cent last year, ""driven mainly by increased interest payments on debt, rising entitlement spending, and relatively low revenue generation"".

Analysts said the cut - which follows downgrades from S&P in 2011 and Fitch in 2023 - could indicate investors will want higher yields on Treasuries, pushing up the cost of government debt.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent dismissed the announcement, saying it was ""a lagging indicator"" and blaming Trump's predecessor Joe Biden.

""We didn't get here in the past 100 days,"" he told CNN. ""It's the Biden administration and the spending that we have seen over the past four years that we inherited, 6.7 per cent deficit-to-GDP, the highest when we weren't in a recession, not in a war.""

White House communications director Steven Cheung hit out at Moody's Analytics on X, singling out its chief economist Mark Zandi.

""Nobody takes his 'analysis' seriously. He has been proven wrong time and time again,"" Cheung posted.

The news added to a frustrating time for the US president after Congress failed to pass his ""big, beautiful Bill"" to extend tax cuts passed in his first term and impose new restrictions on welfare programmes.

Independent congressional analysts say the package would add more than US$4.8 trillion to the federal deficit over the coming decade.

The Bill came up short in a key vote owing to several Republican fiscal hawks, with Congressman French Hill, who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, saying the downgrade ""is a strong reminder that our nation's fiscal house is not in order"".

However, it cleared a key hurdle on Sunday, progressing out of the House Budget Committee after several lawmakers holding up the legislation dropped their opposition, though one, Josh Brecheen, said it ""still required tweaking"".

Tokyo, Sydney, Seoul, Singapore, Wellington, Mumbai, Bangkok and Taipei all fell, while US futures were also well down.

Equities in Hong Kong pared initial losses and Shanghai was flat as below-forecast Chinese retail sales figures reinforced the view that the world's number two economy continues to struggle even after officials unveiled fresh stimulus measures. The reading offset figures showing factory output picked up more than expected.

London, Paris and Frankfurt fell as British and European Union chiefs meet for a landmark summit designed to usher in a closer relationship between the two sides, five years after Brexit.

Ahead of the ""reset"" summit, diplomats said they had resolved key hurdles to an agreement.

The dollar was also down against its peers and gold recovered some recent losses owing to its safe haven appeal, rising to US$3,223 per ounce.

National Australia Bank's Ray Attrill said: ""Moody's actions will have zero impact on any investor's ability or willingness to continue holding US Treasuries - that would likely require downgrades of four or five more notches.""

And SPI Asset Management's Stephen Innes said investors would be more interested in upcoming data.

""Moody's may have dropped the mic, but for equity traders, the real test this week will be Main Street,"" he wrote in a note.

""We're heading into a make-or-break retail earnings slate - Target, Home Depot, Lowe's, TJX, Ralph Lauren all report - and this is where tariff theory collides with checkout-line reality.

""Yes, the S&P has clawed back 18 per cent since the 'Liberation Day' tariff blitz, but the consumer has been the market's unsung hero. Now they're about to be audited.""",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/markets-drop-us-loses-last-triple-credit-rating-moodys-5139201,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z
CNA,Japan halts some poultry imports from Brazil after bird flu outbreak,"TOKYO: Japan has suspended imports of poultry meat from the southern Brazilian city of Montenegro and live poultry from the wider state of Rio Grande do Sul following a bird flu outbreak, an official at Japan's agriculture ministry said on Monday (May 19).

The ban took effect on Friday after Brazil, the world's largest chicken exporter, confirmed its first outbreak of bird flu on a poultry farm. The announcement triggered protocols for a countrywide trade ban from top buyer China and statewide restrictions for other major consumers.

Over half of China's chicken imports are from Brazil.

Japan also relies heavily on chicken imports from Brazil, and the spread of bird flu in Brazil could affect the meat market in Japan, where food prices are already on the rise.



According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Japan's self-sufficiency rate for poultry meat, including processed products, is around 65 per cent.

In the 2024 fiscal year, which ended on Mar 31, Japan imported about 429,000 metric tons of chicken meat from Brazil, accounting for nearly 70 per cent of poultry meat imports, excluding processed items.

""We will closely monitor the impact on domestic distribution and market conditions,"" a ministry official said.

The European Union and South Korea are among other major importers who have banned Brazilian chicken.

Singapore imports 48 per cent of poultry from Brazil, according to figures from 2021. CNA has contacted the Singapore Food Agency for information on potential measures in response to the bird flu outbreak in the Brazilian city.

The first case of bird flu was reported on a commercial farm in Montenegro, in Rio Grande do Sul state.

On Saturday, teams from Vibra Foods, a Brazilian operation backed by Tyson Foods TSN.N, which runs the farm, buried waste that had first been incinerated to prevent the spread of the virus.

The virus killed around 15,000 birds and the farm culled an additional 2,000. Vibra Foods did not respond to requests for comment.

Brazilian authorities at the state and federal levels have scrambled to prevent the disease from spreading.

On Saturday, the government of Minas Gerais state said it destroyed 450 metric tons of eggs from Rio Grande do Sul.

Eggs from the affected farm were traced to locations in Minas Gerais, Parana and Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil's agriculture ministry said, adding they would be destroyed.

Brazil's agriculture ministry and Rio Grande do Sul's department of agriculture have created a task force in Montenegro to prevent the virus from spreading, with officials visiting 524 properties within a 10km radius of the farm where the first case was found.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/brazil-bird-flu-outbreak-japan-halts-poultry-imports-5138656,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z
CNA,Nvidia unveils plan for Taiwan's first 'AI supercomputer',"TAIPEI: Nvidia boss Jensen Huang announced plans for Taiwan's ""first AI supercomputer"", as he showcased on Monday (May 19) the company's latest advances in artificial intelligence.

Global semiconductor chip giants have gathered in Taiwan for the island's top tech expo, Computex, as the sector grapples with the impact of US tariffs and disrupted supply chains.

Huang said Nvidia would work with Taiwanese tech giants Foxconn and TSMC as well as the government to build Taiwan's ""first AI supercomputer here for the AI infrastructure and AI ecosystem"".

""Taiwan doesn't just build supercomputers for the world ... we're also building AI for Taiwan,"" Huang said in a keynote address, describing the island as the ""centre"" of the industry.



""Having a world-class AI infrastructure in Taiwan is really important.""

Taiwan-born Huang also spotlighted a further upgrade to Nvidia's Blackwell processing platform, as well as new hardware and software for robotics and ""AI agents"" that can perform company tasks.

And he announced a new version of Nvidia's NVLink technology, enabling customers to build semi-custom AI infrastructure.

""In 10 years time, you will look back and you will realise that AI has now integrated into everything and in fact we need AI everywhere,"" Huang said, wearing his trademark black leather jacket.

Computex will draw computer and chip companies from around the world to Taiwan, whose semiconductor industry is critical to the production of everything from iPhones to the servers that run ChatGPT.

Taiwan produces the bulk of the world's most advanced chips, including those needed for the most powerful AI applications and research.

Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon announced the company planned to expand into data centres, but he did not elaborate.

Top executives from MediaTek and Foxconn will also speak at Computex, where advances in moving AI from data centres into laptops, robots and cars are in the spotlight.

Tech expert Paul Yu told AFP the industry was at a ""critical juncture"" for AI hardware development.

""Over the past two and a half years, significant investment has driven rapid advances in AI technology,"" said Yu, of Witology Markettrend Research Institute.

He added that ""2025 to 2026 will be the crucial period for transitioning AI model training into profitable applications"".

While US tariffs were the biggest issue facing the sector, most companies at Computex ""will shy away from addressing tariffs directly as the situation is too uncertain"", said Eric Smith of specialist platform TechInsights.

Last month, Washington announced a national security probe into imports of semiconductor technology, which could put the industry in the crosshairs of President Donald Trump's trade bazooka and inflict potentially devastating levies.

Since taking office in January, Trump has threatened hefty tariffs against many of America's biggest trade partners with the aim of forcing companies to move production to US soil.

Export-dependent Taiwan has pledged to increase investment in the United States as it seeks to avoid a 32 per cent US tariff on its shipments.

But there are concerns the island could lose its dominance of the chip sector - the so-called ""silicon shield"" protecting it from an invasion or blockade by China and an incentive for the United States to defend it.

TSMC, the Taiwanese contract chipmaking giant, has unveiled plans to inject an additional US$100 billion into the United States, on top of the US$65 billion already pledged.

TSMC-supplier GlobalWafers also announced plans last week to increase its US investment by US$4 billion as the Taiwanese company opened a wafer facility in the US state of Texas.

Competition is intensifying as US export restrictions on certain AI chips to China drives local players to develop their own.

Chinese tech giant Xiaomi will invest nearly US$7 billion in developing high-end smartphone chips, the firm's founder said on Monday.

Huang was optimistic on Friday when asked about the impact of tariffs on Taiwan, saying the island would ""remain at the centre of the technology ecosystem"".

""I fully expect Taiwan to continue to thrive ... before, after, throughout,"" Huang told reporters.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/nvidia-jensen-huang-taiwan-first-ai-supercomputer-5138516,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z
CNA,Former actor Ian Fang jailed 40 months for sexual offences against minor,"SINGAPORE: Former actor Ian Fang was sentenced to 40 months' jail on Monday (May 19) after pleading guilty to sexual offences involving a minor.

The 35-year-old's identity was made public on Monday after a gag order was lifted.

Fang, whose registered name is Fang Wei Jie, pleaded guilty to three charges of sexual penetration of a girl under 16. Three similar charges were taken into consideration for sentencing, along with one count of obstructing justice and one count of stalking.

A gag order remains on the identity of the victim, who was 15 at the time of the offences in 2024. Fang was 34 when the pair met at an entertainment event.

The prosecution, represented by Deputy Public Prosecutor Lynda Lee, applied to have the gag order on Fang's identity lifted on Monday. The girl stated in her victim impact statement that she was now ""emotionally stronger"" and was willing to bear the risk of being eventually identified.

Fang's lawyer Noelle Teoh objected to lifting the gag order, arguing that the victim could be identified as a result. Ms Teoh said that at least 30 people have seen Fang and the victim socially at events, adding that no one can guarantee how being identified will impact the victim.

Noting the defence's concerns, the prosecution replied that it had taken steps to remove identifying details from court documents.

District Judge Eddy Tham said the courts needed to tread a balance between protecting victims and the need for open, transparent justice.

He noted the wishes of the victim and her family in this case and issued a fresh gag order, which excluded Fang's name.

Fang was a full-time actor with Mediacorp for 12 years until he left the media company in 2023. Born in Shanghai and educated in Singapore, Fang is a Singapore permanent resident.

At the time of the offences, Fang was an acting teacher with a child modelling school which provides classes for students aged four to 14.

Fang met the victim at an entertainment event in May 2024, according to court documents. They exchanged contact details and chatted nearly every day.

In June 2024, Fang engaged in mostly unprotected sexual acts with the victim on nine occasions. He knew that the victim was only 15. 
On Jun 6, the victim's mother checked her into a hotel as the victim had contracted COVID-19.

That night, Fang visited her in her hotel room, where they had sex. By then, she had started seeing Fang as a boyfriend, but he told her to keep mum about their relationship.

On Jun 12, the victim left the hotel room to meet Fang, who asked to see her. At about 12am on Jun 13, the pair went to Fang's home where they engaged in unprotected sex. She returned to the hotel room later that morning.

The court heard that the victim's mother would check in on her daughter at the hotel room at about 12pm.

""When the victim arrived at her hotel room at about 10am, the accused texted her to chat with her.

""During the chat, he had asked if she was 'safe', which meant whether she managed to evade (her mother's) detection given that she left the hotel room earlier,"" the prosecution told the court.

On Jun 17, the victim was admitted to a hospital for a flu infection and was staying in a private room. Her mother was with her but left for home later on.

At around midnight, after ensuring that the victim was alone, Fang visited her and the two had unprotected sex.

The victim's mother eventually found out about the sexual encounters and forbade the girl from contacting him. The mother called the police on Aug 3.

Fang was arrested on Aug 4 and released on bail the next day.

By then, the victim was feeling depressed and had been crying every day.

Despite instructions from an investigation officer not to contact the victim, Fang reached out to the victim through social media. He told her that he could not be the one contacting her, but that she would have to contact him instead.

""The victim who still had feelings for the accused obliged and called him,"" Ms Lee said.

""During their phone conversations, the accused kept talking about how he would commit suicide if he went to jail.

""The accused also asked the victim to cry before (her mother) and tell her that she did not want him to go to jail and not to press charges against him.""
This made the victim feel worse and she started having suicidal thoughts. She was admitted into the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) from Aug 23 to Aug 28, 2024 and diagnosed with adjustment disorder with depressed mood.

While the victim decided to cease contact with Fang, he continued to harass her by contacting her multiple times.

On Sep 22, 2024, Fang called the victim 18 times and sent her a WhatsApp message referring to the victim's close friend. That same month, Fang logged into the victim’s virtual room in a karaoke application.

Submitting for a jail term of 36 to 40 months, Ms Lee cited a high degree of exploitation by Fang and the ""significant psychological and emotional harm"" suffered by the victim.

In her victim impact statement, the girl described feeling very dependent on the accused emotionally, including how she felt that the only way to keep him close to her was through sex.

""After the offences were discovered, she had daily crying bouts. Arising from her high dependence on the accused, she resumed contact with him,"" said Ms Lee.

""Instead of finding support, she found herself at the receiving end of the accused’s anxiety about the police investigations, and his pleas to her to persuade her mother to withdraw the case against him.""

The impact statement also stated a marked change in the victim, who has lost her confidence and expressed a fear of middle-aged men.

""It bears noting that, notwithstanding the outcome of this case, the victim will continue to live with the knowledge that her very first sexual encounter was one that was wrong and ended with criminal proceedings,"" said Ms Lee.

Ms Teoh, the defence lawyer, sought no more than 32 months' jail for Fang, whom she said apologised to the victim, her family and those who looked up to him.

The lawyer said Fang had been in a romantic relationship with the victim.

""He met the victim through a mutual friend, and their relationship had developed naturally over time. They bonded over shared interests and similar life experiences, (which led) to a genuine relationship between them where the victim had regarded the accused as her boyfriend,"" said Ms Teoh, who sought to differentiate the case from precedents.

She said Fang had only intended to support the victim as he had a ""natural tendency"" to help those around him.

Ms Teoh disagreed with the prosecution's argument that there was a high degree of exploitation in his case, as court documents did not state that Fang had pressured the victim and there was no coercion involved.

""While the accused did meet the victim at private locations, often during late hours and had asked her to keep their relationship a secret, this was not done with malicious intent but rather out of a desire to maintain discretion and privacy,"" said Ms Teoh, highlighting Fang's profile as a media personality as his reason for wanting to avoid unwanted attention. 
Judge Tham, noting Fang's age at the time of the offences, said he had known what he was doing and what was likely to happen each time he visited the victim.

It was not a one-off incident where Fang acted on the spur of the moment, Judge Tham said. Instead, Fang had ""taken advantage"" of the victim's naivety and emotional vulnerability, he said.

The judge added that Fang's attempt to ""gaslight the victim"" for the sole purpose of ""saving his own neck"" was egregious.

Fang had not cared for the victim's welfare and had breached the investigation officer's instructions not to contact the victim, the judge said.

He allowed Fang to defer his jail term to Jun 16 to settle his personal affairs after increasing his bail by S$10,000 (US$7,700).

Fang made his show business debut in 2011 and shot to fame with the youth-themed drama On The Fringe.

He won Mediacorp’s Star Award for Best Newcomer in 2013 and went on to play leading roles in dramas like Served HOT (2014) and Tiger Mum (2015).

After completing his contract with Mediacorp, Fang became an independent creator and expanded his career into music, entrepreneurship and content creation, according to the defence. He has since put most of his projects on hold due to the court case.

Editor's note: This article previously stated that it was Fang, and not the victim's mother, who checked the victim into a hotel when she contracted COVID-19. We apologise for the error.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ian-fang-jailed-sexual-offences-minor-5138806,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z
CNA,"Former Wah!Banana actor who raped woman he met on Tinder gets more than 11 years' jail, caning","SINGAPORE: Former Wah!Banana actor Lev Panfilov was on Monday (May 19) sentenced to 11 years and six months in jail, as well as 12 strokes of the cane, for raping, sexually assaulting and molesting a woman he met on dating app Tinder.

The Singapore permanent resident, who used to act for the comedy channel, was previously convicted by a High Court judge after he claimed trial to all four charges against him – two of rape, one of sexual assault by penetration and one of molest.

The victim cannot be named due to a gag order protecting her identity.

Panfilov intends to appeal his conviction and sentence, his lawyers said. The 29-year-old asked for 15 minutes to speak to his mother and partner, who were in the public gallery, after the hearing on Monday concluded.

When he found Panfilov guilty in March, Justice Pang Khang Chau had said that the victim had been an ""unusually convincing"" witness, while Panfilov was not a credible witness.

Justice Pang found irregularities in his evidence to be ""symptomatic of his attempt to distance himself from events"", albeit unsuccessfully.

During his sentencing on Monday, the prosecution asked for 14 years in jail with 16 strokes of the cane for Panfilov.

The harm caused to the victim was both physical and mental, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Sheldon Lim, noting that Panfilov's two rape convictions involved a ""significant degree"" of physical pain.

The 29-year-old also showed a lack of remorse while the trial was ongoing, which warrants a ""significant upward calibration"" of his sentence, he added.

During the trial in 2023, Panfilov was represented by a different set of lawyers. The prosecution argued on Monday that the 29-year-old ""prolonged his trial unnecessarily"" by subjecting the victim to a ""marathon"" 13 days of cross-examination.

""There was repeated questioning of the victim on areas that the defence had already canvassed,"" said the prosecution.

In mitigation, the defence argued that all of the offences resulted from a ""single continuous act"" that took place in two hours on the day of the incident.

Panfilov's lawyer Sameer Melber from Gabriel Law Corporation highlighted that according to the undisputed series of events, the victim ""voluntarily"" met him, booked her own ride to his house and boarded the car herself.

She also voluntarily entered his room and sat on his bed, which shows that she ended up on his bed ""of her own volition"". There is no evidence that he dragged or forced her to enter the room, said the lawyer.

The events that transpired in the lead-up to Panfilov's molestation offence were ""spontaneous and occurred in the heat of the moment"", said his lawyers.

The defence argued for 10 years and five months in jail and six strokes of the cane for him. Mr Sameer noted that Panfilov is a first-time offender, intends to get married later this year if he can and will continue pursuing his university education while in prison.

Panfilov was arrested on Dec 9, 2023, and has been in remand ever since. His sentence will be backdated accordingly.

In delivering his sentencing decision, Justice Pang said that, without diminishing the harm suffered by the victim, he did not agree with the prosecution that the level of harm she suffered constituted a separate aggravating factor, stressing that the level of harm associated with rape is already very serious.

He also addressed the prosecution's arguments about Panfilov's lack of remorse, noting that the former actor had attempted to leave the country without permission while out on bail.

He added that while the prolonged cross-examination could have retraumatised the victim, the defence was ""careful"" not to cross-examine the victim in a scandalous manner.

The high-profile verdict in March attracted comments from the former vice-president of the Law Society of Singapore Chia Boon Teck. In a post on LinkedIn, Mr Chia appeared to question the victim's actions and made comments that were perceived as victim-shaming.

His comments drew widespread backlash and outrage from the public, including members of the legal fraternity, and the Law Society asked him to resign from his post.

Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam also weighed in, stating that ""shaming and blaming victims steps over the line"" and that ""any misogyny should have no place in our society"".

The prosecution's case had been that Panfilov sexually assaulted the victim in his room on Jan 12, 2021, following a meet-up with the victim at a Wine Connection restaurant earlier that day.

The victim, a model-actress and an aspiring comedy scriptwriter, wanted Panfilov's help with her scriptwriting.

They started working on the script at the restaurant and left to continue doing so at Panfilov's residence.

As the two were watching comedians on YouTube in his room, Panfilov suddenly kissed the victim on her lips, and subsequently sexually assaulted her.

Over the next few days, the victim reported feeling depressed but decided against telling her mother or sister for fear of worrying them.

She finally decided to see a doctor as she worried about the pain in her vaginal area and lower abdomen, and was told by the doctor to lodge a police report.

The victim then spoke to several police officers on Jan 16, 2021, but decided against lodging a report, worried that the police would not believe her and that others would find out about the incident.

She also felt traumatised about having to explain what happened to the police officers.

She lodged a police report on Jan 18, 2021, after having told her mother about the incident.

The defence sought to argue that the victim had initiated the sexual encounter and that both then progressed to consensual sex.

Those convicted of rape can be sentenced to a maximum of 20 years' jail and fined or caned.

The penalties for sexual assault by penetration are the same as those for rape.

Those convicted of molestation can be jailed for up to two years, fined, caned, or given any combination of these punishments.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/wah-banana-lev-panfilov-rape-chia-boon-teck-victim-shaming-5139086,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z

CNA,Don Don Donki selling ‘eco-friendly’ carrier plastic bags in stores again to ‘support’ customers’ needs,"SINGAPORE: Seven months after discontinuing the sale of plastic bags for shoppers to carry away their buys, Japanese retail chain Don Don Donki said on Monday (May 19) that it is offering plastic bags at its stores again.

With immediate effect, it will make available biodegradable plastic bags that shoppers at its outlets may pay 5 cents a bag to use.

It said in a Facebook post that it wants to better support its customers' needs while remaining ""committed to its environmental responsibilities"".

It also said that the eco-friendly bags were specially designed to break down naturally over time, reducing the long-term impact on the environment.

This would allow customers to carry their items ""with a greater peace of mind"", it added.

At the same time, it continues to encourage shoppers to take along their own reusable bags whenever possible, it said.

Under the law, all supermarket operators with an annual turnover of more than S$100 million (US$77.2 million) are required to charge at least 5 cents for each disposable carrier bag. This has been in force since July 2023.

These large supermarkets include FairPrice, Cold Storage, Giant, Sheng Siong, Prime Supermarket and Don Don Donki.

In 2023, large supermarket operators account for around two-thirds – or about 400 – of all supermarkets in Singapore.

Before the law came into effect, Don Don Donki outlets charged 10 cents for each plastic bag, before it changed to charging 5 cents a bag regardless of size to comply with the law.

In October 2024, the Japanese retail chain announced that it would stop the sale of plastic bags at its 17 outlets in Singapore.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/don-don-donki-plastic-bag-shoppers-customers-eco-friendly-5139186,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z
CNA,Foreign worker crushed at Tengah worksite did not follow colleague's instructions: Coroner,"SINGAPORE: A foreign worker who died after his chest was crushed at a worksite in Tengah did not follow his colleague’s instructions, a coroner’s inquiry found on Friday (May 16).

Mr Ponraman Eazhumalai, 23, was crushed by machinery on a truck operated by the same colleague, who did not notice him before the accident happened.

The Indian national suffered the fatal injury on Dec 2, 2023, at a worksite for the upcoming Tengah integrated rail and bus depot in Jurong Road. Coroner Brenda Chua found there was no evidence of foul play in his death, attributing it to a work-related accident.

Mr Eazhumalai was an assistant pump operator at TMC Concrete Pumping Services and his colleague was a concrete pump truck operator.

The two had completed their concrete casting work at about 10.50pm that night, and were preparing to retract the machinery on the truck when the accident happened.

Mr Eazhumalai’s colleague retracted the hydraulic jack of the right outrigger, or stabilising leg, at the back of the truck, and instructed him not to remove the metal plates that were placed on the ground below the hydraulic jacks, coroner Brenda Chua found.

His colleague proceeded to close the rear right outrigger while retracting the hydraulic jack for the outrigger at the truck's front right. Since he was looking at the front right hydraulic jack, he did not realise that Mr Eazhumalai had collected the metal plate at the back of the truck, contrary to his instructions.

The 23-year-old Indian national was placing the plate onto the truck after collecting it, and was eventually caught between the machinery and the truck.

Mr Eazhumalai shouted, and his colleague turned around and saw that he was stuck.

The colleague immediately opened the outrigger to release Mr Eazhumalai, who walked and collapsed forward, sustaining abrasions to his forehead and nasal bridge, Judge Chua found.

The colleague who was operating the truck and another worker who was nearby rendered assistance to him. While he was conscious, responsive and did not seem to have any severe visible injuries, he had difficulty breathing.

He was sent to Farrer Park Hospital with a severe chest crush injury, with bleeding in both lungs. He died in the hospital about 18 hours later.

The company’s operations manager said during the inquiry that Mr Eazhumalai was supposed to collect the plates only after all the outriggers were retracted.

According to the company’s safe work processes, the operator of the truck must also be responsible for safety in the working area when the machine is in use.

For example, the operator must look at the outrigger while closing it to ensure no one is standing between the machinery and the truck.

Mr Vellaisamy had not looked at the machinery or noticed Mr Eazhumalai, though the latter was within his visual field and wearing a bright yellow reflective vest, the court heard.

At the time of the inquiry, the Ministry of Manpower was considering taking enforcement actions against the parties involved. Court documents did not state which parties these were.

Mr Eazhumalai’s family members had initial concerns about why he was not sent to a hospital nearer to the worksite. In response, Judge Chua noted that he was brought to the hospital in a conscious and responsive state.

The 23-year-old survived for several hours, going through imaging and other procedures before he passed away, she added.

“As such, it did not appear that the time difference taken to travel to a further hospital within Singapore … would have significantly contributed to his death.”",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/tengah-workplace-accident-foreign-worker-ponraman-eazhumalai-5139501,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z
CNA,CNA Explains: Why are sea robberies spiking in the Singapore Strait?,"SINGAPORE: Since the start of 2025, a total of 50 sea robbery incidents have been reported in the Straits of Malacca and Singapore.

All of them took place in the Singapore Strait, according to data from the Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia (ReCAAP).

This was a stark increase from 14 incidents over the same period (Jan 1 to May 7) last year.

As one of the world's busiest shipping lanes with over 1,000 vessels passing through daily, the Singapore Strait has long been flagged by ReCAAP as an area of concern due to a perpetual rash of sea robberies.

Sea robberies typically occur within a state's internal waters, archipelagic waters and territorial sea; while piracy refers to illegal acts of violence or detention committed on the high seas.

ReCAAP, together with its Information Sharing Centre, was proposed as far back as in 1999 after countries in the region expressed concern over sea robbery cases.

In the Singapore Strait alone, an upward trend can be observed since 2019.

There were 31 incidents that year - from seven in 2018. These include both actual and attempted attacks.

The number has continued to rise steadily, reaching 61 last year.

That figure out of the Singapore Strait is more than half of the 116 sea robbery incidents reported globally last year, to the International Maritime Bureau.

These reports take into account attacks in locations such as Southeast Asia, East Asia, the Indian subcontinent, the Americas and Africa.

Out of the 50 reported this year so far, 47 were in the eastbound lane of the Singapore Strait's Traffic Separation Scheme, which routes and prevents collisions between maritime vessels travelling in opposing directions.

The locations were predominantly in the proximity of neighbouring islands to Singapore, one of which lies about 14km south of the mainland.

The sea robbers here tend to go after portable items not secured to ships. These include engine and generator spare parts, as well as scrap metal.

In other incidents, ship stores such as padlocks and work tools like a hand drill and a jig saw machine were looted.

Robbers sometimes make off with personal belongings too.

However, in half of the incidents in the Singapore Strait this year, the perpetrators actually left empty-handed.

Maritime security researcher Ian Storey told CNA the majority of the attacks occurred in Indonesian waters. A number of organised criminal gangs, believed to be operating from the Riau Islands, were said to be behind most of them, he added.

The ringleaders of these gangs often employ fishermen who find themselves temporarily out of work, noted the senior fellow in the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute think tank.

Mr Toby Stephens from global maritime law firm HFW said the robbers also appear to be based in the more remote islands of Indonesia, such as Pulau Cula.

""In many cases they are opportunistically taking advantage of their remote location, which makes tracking, tracing and pursuit of the perpetrators more difficult,"" said the head of HFW's Asia-Pacific crisis management team.

""The evidence suggests that they are low-level, opportunistic criminals; armed, but rarely violent; and unidentified and elusive.""

In all of the 50 incidents this year, the robbers targeted mostly large bulk carriers and tankers while they were sailing.

Most of the attacks took place during the early hours of the day, typically between 1am and 6am.

The robbers tended to travel on small vessels such as boats and sampans, which are wooden boats with a flat bottom. They would approach the back of the ships such as the aft deck or the stern, and climb up the hull using hooks or ropes.

Most of them were armed with knives. Some other weapons include hammers and parangs, which are cleavers commonly used in Malaysia and Indonesia. In three incidents, the perpetrators carried guns.

When the culprits are armed, the incident is typically classified as Category 3 and upwards.

Majority of the reports in the Singapore Strait this year were spread across Categories 3 and 4, which are seen as ""less"" or ""least"" significant.

Five incidents were assessed as Category 2, with crew members tied up in some cases. But nothing reported so far has been classed as Category 1.

Incidents in this category involve a large number of armed perpetrators, with the crew suffering some form of injury or physical violence and the ship either hijacked or its cargo such as oil plundered.

ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute's Dr Storey said a variety of factors are at work, including poor socioeconomic conditions; corruption within shipping companies and law enforcement agencies; and the target-rich environment in the Singapore Strait.

Indonesia has a vast maritime domain but ""limited assets"" to police it, said Dr Storey, who also specialises in defence and security issues in Southeast Asia.

""The Indonesian navy and coast guard can't be everywhere all the time.""

The Information Fusion Centre (IFC), a regional maritime security centre under the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN), has also pointed to a mix of seasonal and situational conditions.

In a quarterly summary of incidents during the first three months of 2025, IFC noted that the northeast monsoon - between December and March - has affected fishing yield.

Increased financial burdens leading up to festivities in February and March could have pushed locals to resort to petty crime in coastal waters to supplement their income, the centre added.

Concern, yes - but not alarm, said Dr Storey.

He reiterated that the majority of attacks involve petty theft rather than hijacking, kidnapping or stealing cargo.

For this same reason, he - as well as HFW's Mr Stephens - believes the impact on maritime trade so far has been minimal.

Both experts, however, said insurance premiums could go up for vessels passing through the Singapore Strait, should attacks remain unchecked or grow in frequency and intensity.

Shipping companies would pass on these costs to their clients, who would in turn pass them on to consumers.

But Mr Stephens said it was ""unlikely"" that the man on the street would feel any sort of impact.

""When compared to the total vessels trading through the Straits each year, (the number of sea robberies) is a tiny, tiny proportion,"" he noted. ""By example, the Port of Singapore alone recorded a record high of 3.11 billion gross tonnes of arriving ship traffic (last year).""

The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), the Singapore Police Coast Guard (PCG) and the RSN work together to secure territorial waters.

MPA regularly issues information on sea robbery incidents in the Straits of Singapore and Malacca, to vessels most commonly involved in such incidents.

PCG leans on international cooperation, patrols and a network of cameras and other systems to respond to criminal activities within Singapore's territorial waters.

It will board vessels that have encountered armed robbery incidents in Singapore waters, and investigate accordingly.

For the RSN, it set up a Maritime Security Task Force in 2009, and a Singapore Maritime Crisis Centre in 2011.

The navy's IFC also shares real-time information among Singapore's neighbours, as part of close collaboration that also involves coordinated sea and air patrols.

The Singapore Strait also includes the territorial waters of Malaysia and Indonesia.

Even closer and greater collaboration among Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia is the way forward, said the analysts CNA spoke to.

""Indonesia should allow Singapore and Malaysia 'hot pursuit rights' into its waters,"" said Dr Storey.

He also called on Indonesia to crack down on the criminal gangs behind the attacks at sea, such as by arresting and convicting the sea robbers. ""At the moment, very few perpetrators are detained and prosecuted.""

Mr Stephens said the three countries could provide joint guidance to seafarers and mariners transiting the region on what to look out for, along with preventive measures and avenues to seek assistance.

He added that more patrols in remote areas identified as hotspots - possibly assisted by the use of drones and unmanned systems -  would also be helpful.

""But, in all honesty, it is very unlikely to eradicate the practice entirely, unless the underlying socioeconomic and political factors are eradicated.""",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/sea-robberies-singapore-strait-piracy-maritime-security-cna-explains-5135076,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z
CNA,Vietnam seeks development and balance in game-changing cross-border rail links with China,"HANOI: Chatter filled the platform as 67-year-old Mr Ma Ronghong’s tour group boarded their waiting train at Hanoi’s railway station.

An unmissable red and white banner hung outside one of the carriages, warmly welcoming the passengers onboard the “Vietnam-China friendship train”.

“Neighbours are great, better than distant relatives,” said Mr Ma, who is visiting Vietnam for the first time.

The retiree, who hails from China’s Chengdu city, was on a 12-day tour through Vietnam by train and bus, setting off from Nanning in southern China's Guangxi province.

Currently, passengers and goods must swap trains at the border because the ageing Vietnamese railway gauge is incompatible with China’s high-speed railway.

""To be honest, the transportation (in Vietnam) and its level of development now is not as good and cannot compare with China’s,” said Mr Ma, who added he did not mind the longer journey.

""But if they improve this last mile, it will definitely be a win-win for everyone.”

This could become a reality, with new cross-border rail links between China and Vietnam on the cards.

These projects are set to be a game changer for Hanoi, with increased trade and tourism expected between the two countries.

“I think travellers won’t feel as tired from the journey anymore. If the two countries’ railways are directly connected, it’ll be much easier and more convenient to come to Vietnam and enjoy its beautiful scenery,” said tour guide Mr Zhou Jianwei.

He added this would mean greater ease in handling its large groups, which go up to 300 participants each time.

The Chinese tour agency that Mr Zhou works for began running such rail tours a year ago, and it has seen growing interest from Chinese tourists.

It has since increased the tour's frequency from once a month to about five times a month.

Tour packages cost less than US$400, which the agency says is a cheaper alternative to flying for visitors looking to visit multiple cities in a single trip.

""There won’t be all those issues like changing trains or clearing customs - it’ll all be much simpler and more convenient,” added Mr Zhou, who expressed hope for the cross-border service to start soon.

China and Vietnam have long discussed collaboration on three railway projects.

Both countries launched a new railway cooperation mechanism during a visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping to Hanoi last month, with the goal of aligning their railway gauges.

An agreement to conduct feasibility studies for two of these projects was also inked, while a third railway line is set to begin construction in 2025.

That 403km-long passenger and freight line is expected to connect Kunming in China’s south, to Lao Cai at the border in Vietnam. It will then run through the capital Hanoi to reach Hai Phong on Vietnam’s northern coast, where a key international port is located.

Reports say the new line is expected to include 18 stations and trains will be able to travel at top speeds of 160kmh.

The US$8 billion project, which is to be partially funded through Chinese loans, is an upgrade for Vietnam’s ageing railway infrastructure that dates to French colonial times.

""If I go to China, I often go by car, so (if there is a train link with China), I will choose the train when I go on trips or travel with friends, so that I can experience more of other public transportation modes,” said 28-year-old freelancer Mr Vi Dinh Tian.

""I think that the train linking from Hanoi to China is also a very interesting experience in the future,” he added.

""This will be very convenient for trade. Hai Phong has a very large port, so (the new train link) will shorten a lot of travel time from Hai Phong straight to Lao Cai, instead of transiting through Hanoi,” added 37-year-old driver Mr Le Minh Quan.

Vietnam’s top leader To Lam said building the three railways was the “highest priority” in infrastructure cooperation between the two sides and called on China to offer concessional loans.

""The prioritised goals of Vietnamese leaders at the moment is to enhance its economic development and to diversify away from any single partner, which is the United States,” said Dr Nguyen Khac Giang, visiting fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute.

He added railway projects would improve cooperation on the economic and trade fronts with China, as Beijing has been keen to show its support for neighbours in the face of sweeping global US tariffs.

China has been on a charm offensive seeking deeper cooperation with its trading partners, especially in Southeast Asia in the face of its trade war with the US.

However, Dr Nguyen pointed out that the bilateral agreements announced during President Xi’s visit have been limited to cross-border projects.

""The rationale is that, because it's connecting Vietnam and China, so China should be a prioritised partner in financing and in providing the know-how,” said Dr Nguyen.

The agreements did not involve Vietnam’s larger north-south high-speed railway project, set to link Hanoi in the north with Ho Chi Minh City in the south in around six hours.

He added that if there are any delays with the project, this would be limited to just one area in north Vietnam.

This comes as Vietnam seeks to hedge against China, preventing any potential spillover implications of Chinese financing or investment.

""The north-south (high-speed railway) project is very important and is connecting, basically the whole length of Vietnam,” said Dr Nguyen.

""So it would need to be considered much more in terms of security and defence as well.”",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/vietnam-china-railway-links-trade-tourism-5138901,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z
CNA,3 killed in lightning strike at Cambodia's Angkor Wat UNESCO site,"BANGKOK: Three people were killed and several others injured when they were struck by lightning while visiting Cambodia's famous Angkor Wat temple complex.

They had been seeking shelter around the main temple of the UNESCO site when the lightning struck on late Friday (May 16) afternoon.

Video posted on social media showed two ambulances arriving in the aftermath and onlookers and site officials carrying out some injured people and helping others out on foot. Other images showed multiple people being treated in the hospital.

The day after the incident, Cambodia's Minister of Tourism Hout Hak issued a statement telling people to take down online posts about it, saying the spreading of “negative information” could harm the country's tourism sector.



Authorities have released no information about the incident, but an official on Monday, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue, confirmed to The Associated Press that three people - all Cambodian - were killed in the lightning strike.

The Cambodian Red Cross also posted an update saying it had delivered care packages to the families of two of the victims, a 34-year-old man and a 52-year-old woman. The Red Cross refused to comment further by phone.

A spokesman for the Angkor Wat site did not respond to requests for comment, nor did a regional health official.

Cambodia's government under Prime Minister Hun Manet keeps a tight grip on information, and has been accused by rights groups of using the court system to prosecute critics and political opponents.

Hun Manet in 2023 succeeded his father, Hun Sen, who was widely criticised for the suppression of freedom of speech during his nearly four decades of autocratic rule.

Angkor Wat is Cambodia's best-known tourist attraction, attracting some 2.5 million visitors annually, and is even featured on the country's flag.

UNESCO calls the site, which sprawls across some 400 sq km and contains the ruins of Khmer Empire capitals from the 9th to the 15th centuries, one of the most important archaeological sites in Southeast Asia.

Cambodia has been actively developing the area to attract more visitors, including opening a new US$1.1 billion Chinese-funded airport in nearby Siem Reap.

Its move to relocate some 10,000 families squatting in the Angkor Wat area to a new settlement has drawn widespread criticism from human rights groups, however, and UNESCO itself has expressed concern.

Cambodian authorities have said the families were being voluntarily relocated, but Amnesty International and others have questioned how voluntary the relocations actually have been.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/cambodia-angkor-wat-unesco-site-3-killed-lightning-strike-5139136,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z
CNA,Man arrested for stabbing four in South Korea,"SEOUL: South Korean police said on Monday (May 19) that a man was arrested after stabbing four people, leaving two dead.

Around 9.30am (8.30am, Singapore time) on Monday, the suspect stabbed a convenience store owner, a woman in her sixties, and fled the scene in Gyeonggi Province, west of Seoul.

After police responded to that stabbing, they went to the home of the car owner linked to the suspect's vehicle.

They discovered a body there which ""is believed to be that of the car owner"", a Siheung Police Station official told AFP, adding that the body appeared to have been left for several days.



About two hours later, the suspect stabbed another man in his seventies before again fleeing the scene.

Shortly after that, police discovered another body near a house close to the convenience store.

The injured victims were receiving treatment at a hospital and were recovering, a police official said.

The suspect remained at large before police apprehended him hours after.

The Siheung police station confirmed to AFP they had arrested the suspect, and the suspect has ""confessed to all charges"".

""We are currently transferring him to the Siheung Police Station for further questioning into his motives and the details of the incident.""

Local residents received a warning message on Monday afternoon from Siheung city hall saying: ""A stabbing incident occurred today in the Jeongwang-dong area"".

It added that police were ""currently searching the scene"".

""Citizens are advised to avoid going out and prioritise their safety.""

The city later sent out another warning message that the suspect was ""in his mid-50s with a balding head, wearing a dark-coloured jumper and pants, and a light blue top"", adding that if he was seen, it should be reported immediately.

""We have released an official public wanted poster for a quick capture,"" a Siheung police official told AFP.

The case comes months after a teacher fatally stabbed an eight-year-old student at an elementary school in South Korea, and most recently, a student who stabbed four at a school.

However, South Korea is generally a very safe country, with a murder rate of 1.3 per 100,000 people in 2021, according to official statistics, well below the global average of six per 100,000.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/east-asia/south-korea-man-stabs-4-arrested-5139511,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z
CNA,‘Please don’t talk about that yet’: Indonesia President Prabowo Subianto responds to calls for a second term,"JAKARTA: Responding to calls for him to contest a second term nearly eight months into his presidency, Indonesia President Prabowo Subianto has said he will defend his position only if he achieves meaningful results in his first term.

Prabowo, 73, made the statement on Saturday (May 17) during a speech to his Gerindra party cadres at the national congress of its youth wing, Tunas Indonesia Raya, in Jakarta, when delegates voiced their support for a two-term presidency.

“I heard some of you say ‘Prabowo two terms’ … Please don’t talk about that yet. We have not even completed a year of this mandate,” he said at Hotel Borobudur, as quoted by local news outlet Jakarta Globe.

According to local media, the president’s remarks came amid growing political chatter within ruling circles about the 2029 presidential election.



Prabowo, a former defence minister, won last February’s presidential election on his third attempt and was inaugurated last October.

He reiterated that fulfilling promises, not political longevity, was his top priority.

“If I assess that I have not achieved what I set out to do, I will not run again,” he added. “I won’t seek re-election if I feel I’ve failed.”

He has set an ambitious target of achieving annual economic growth of 8 per cent by the end of his first term, up from the current rate of about 5 per cent.

Measures his government has taken to support this goal include the launch of the Danantara sovereign wealth fund.

He has also slashed the state budget by about US$44 billion, reportedly channelling some of the savings to his free nutritious meal initiative.

On Saturday, Prabowo also vowed that his government’s anti-graft crackdown will continue, despite law enforcement officers facing intimidation while investigating corruption cases.

""I've received some reports. Some have had people come to their homes, their cars followed, even photographed ... But let me be clear: We will not back down. I will not back down.""

He claimed that hundreds of trillions of rupiah in state assets have been recovered in the first six months of his term.

Leaders of his party’s youth wing, including chairwoman Rahayu Saraswati Djojohadikusumo, who is also his niece, pledged full support should Prabowo run again.

“His vision is clear – zero extreme poverty, 8 per cent economic growth – and he is already acting on it,” Saraswati said on Saturday.

“In four-and-a-half years, we believe the foundation for a strong economy will be laid, regardless of global challenges.”

Saraswati expressed enthusiasm for continuity, adding that her youth wing is confident that voters will reward Prabowo for early initiatives such as the free nutritious meals and affordable housing programmes as well as efforts to achieve agricultural self-sufficiency.

The chairman of the youth wing also added that it would not propose a vice-presidential candidate and would defer to Prabowo’s judgement.

At another event the next day, Gerindra’s secretary-general Ahmad Muzani said the party will continue to support Prabowo in 2029, calling on fellow cadres to “maintain the trust of the people”.

“Pak Prabowo has humbly asked that party cadres remain calm and refrain from voicing support for a second term … but we must continue working hard so we can prove that Gerindra and the Indonesian people want Prabowo to serve two terms,” Ahmad was quoted as saying by Detik news outlet.

Meanwhile, Prabowo’s vice-president Gibran Rakabuming Raka, the son of former president Joko “Jokowi” Widodo, has faced impeachment pressure even as some veteran politicians fancy his chances for the country’s top job in the future.

Earlier this month, news agency Antara reported that a group of retired military officers submitted an eight-point statement to Prabowo, which included demands to reshuffle the Cabinet and unseat Gibran.

According to The Jakarta Post, the former military officers said that Gibran’s nomination in last February’s election, made possible by a last-minute controversial Constitutional Court ruling, had violated procedural rules.

Key figures who endorsed the statement include former vice-president Try Sutrisno and former religious affairs minister Fachrul Razi.

While Gibran’s lack of substantial duties as vice-president so far have been reported by Indonesian media, Gerindra’s former deputy chairman Arief Poyuono said last month that the 37-year-old “has a 98 per cent” chance of becoming Indonesia’s next president in 2029, reported news site JPNN.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/indonesia-president-prabowo-subianto-second-term-gibran-reelection-5139031,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z
CNA,Nail Palace director fails to get jail term replaced with fine after breaching consumer protection orders,"SINGAPORE: The director of a nail salon chain that did not take court-ordered steps to protect consumers will serve three months in jail for contempt of court after his appeal to the High Court fell through on Monday (May 19).

Mr Kaiden Cheng, the managing director of two outlets under Nail Palace, had attempted to have his four-month jail term replaced with a S$10,000 (US$7,700) fine or reduced to five days' imprisonment.

He argued that his businesses had since complied with court orders by publishing notices in four major newspapers to inform the public of their unfair trade practices, and implementing a new consumer notification form in January.

However, Justice Audrey Lim found that a jail term was warranted as Nail Palace's breach of the court orders had substantial and irremediable effects.

As a result, many existing and new customers who bought services from the salons would have been deprived of the knowledge that they had engaged in unfair trade practices, she said.

Justice Lim further found that Nail Palace's breaches were ongoing, because its new consumer notification form and processes did not satisfy the court order.

In February and March, two Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) officers made four undercover visits to the two salons in Bukit Panjang and Simei to conduct spot checks.

They reported that they did not sign the consumer notification form until after the salons had started providing manicure or pedicure services to them.

At that point, services such as feet-washing, nail clipping and buffing, and application of basecoats to their nails had already been performed.

The claim that these were preparatory acts and common practice among nail salons as a prelude to the actual services was unbelievable, said Justice Lim.

Nail Palace's non-compliance with the consumer notification order was therefore ""continuing, egregious and persistent"".

She also noted that Nail Palace had a history of disregarding court orders, and that the salons' conduct showed they were not serious about making sure they were not in contempt of court.

There was public interest in ensuring prompt compliance with such court orders and bringing unfair business practices to the attention of consumers at large, said Justice Lim.

She reduced Mr Cheng's jail term by a quarter after taking into account that Nail Palace's January notices in the newspapers did comply with the court order, although they came more than 17 months after the initial deadline.

The two Nail Palace businesses were also ordered to pay costs and disbursements to CCCS.

As Mr Cheng's jail term was read out by the judge, a cry arose from the public gallery where he was seated with supporters. His sentence was deferred to May 26 to allow him to attend his sister's wedding.

Nail Palace (BPP) and Nail Palace (SM) were originally taken to task for unfair trade practices over the sale of anti-fungal treatment packages.

This included misleading a consumer over the need for anti-fungal treatment, and failing to inform a consumer that certain lip products were not free but included in the price of an anti-fungal treatment package.

In August and September 2022, CCCS obtained injunctions to stop both businesses from these unfair practices.

A district court ordered both businesses to publish a notice of the declarations and injunctions against them in four major Singapore newspapers by Aug 18, 2023.

For a period of two years, the businesses were also supposed to inform customers that they had engaged in the unfair practices and obtain customers' written acknowledgement of this before entering into contracts with them.

However, the businesses failed to comply with these requirements. In a first, CCCS took them to court for breach of the orders, and they were found guilty of contempt of court in September 2024.

Mr Cheng was sentenced to jail while Nail Palace (BPP) and Nail Palace (SM) were each fined S$15,000, which they have paid.

In a statement, CCCS chief executive Alvin Koh said: ""The High Court's judgment today sends a strong and clear message that businesses and managers who disregard court orders designed to protect consumer interests will face serious consequences.""

He added that the case demonstrated the commission's firm resolve to enforce the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act and hold businesses and individuals accountable when they deliberately flout their legal obligations.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/nail-palace-consumer-protection-director-jail-cccs-5138936,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z
CNA,Commentary: Good riddance to the SGX watchlist,"SINGAPORE: In a nod to the increasing diversity and complexity of the stock market and investors, the Singapore Exchange Regulation (SGX RegCo) has proposed shifting its regulatory stance towards a more proactive disclosure-based regime.

SGX RegCo said the new regime - which it is presenting for a month-long public consultation - will focus on “the materiality of information that needs to be disclosed in a timely and accurate manner”. In doing so, the new approach emphasises a pro-enterprise bias and gives investors information to make their own decisions.

In short, the move away from the current prescriptive model of disclosure brings forth the principle of caveat emptor or “buyer beware” for investors.

As SGX RegCo put it, the market can better discriminate in favour of companies with high standards of corporate governance and disclosure.

“The effectiveness of such a market-driven approach rests on a foundation of rules and standards that assure market participants that the information on which they base their decisions is accurate and accessible, and that the market is fair,” said CEO Tan Boon Gin in a statement on Thursday (May 15).

This is big.

Ever since the S$8 billion penny stock crash in 2013, regulators have taken a hard line on market malfeasance - both real and perceived. In the weeks leading up to October 2013, Malaysian businessman John Soh Chee Wen and his associates engaged in one of the largest stock manipulations on the Singapore bourse, centred on three stocks: Blumont Group, Asiasons Capital and LionGold Corp.

Responding to this, SGX RegCo has taken a very top-down prescriptive approach to market monitoring over the past 12 years, jumping in not just when management, directors or owners strayed from the rules, but even when there were perceived unusual stock price movements.

All this has had a chilling effect on the market and effectively killed the “animal spirits” which is critical to maintain healthy speculative interest which is often the lifeblood of trading activity.

As a result, the Singapore market has remained the most moribund in the region as liquidity dried up, price discovery evaporated, valuations hit the floor and new listings disappeared.

Meanwhile, delistings have become common.

So could the proposed measures announced on Thursday evening change all this?

It is too early to say. That said, it is a step in the right direction to rejuvenate this market. But much more needs to be done.

While the proposals include a gamut of initiatives, including changes in qualitative and quantitative listing criteria, the most effective initiatives could be the scrapping of the financial “Watch-List” and the adoption of a more targeted approach in post-listing queries.

The much-disliked Watch-List - a “penitentiary” for companies with multi-year losses and falling market capitalisation - effectively sidelined these corporations. In the process, it killed business confidence and made it near impossible for these companies to raise capital.

Meanwhile, the severe and open-ended SGX RegCo queries - often about perceived unusual stock price movements - caused nervousness and alarm in the broader market. Some have likened this approach to a town sheriff in a spaghetti Western who charges into a saloon, guns drawn, causing panic-stricken patrons to dive for cover, when in fact there is only one crook slinking in the far corner of the bar.

So how will all this impact the Singapore bourse?

In reality, SGX RegCo’s proposals dovetail with one of the recommendations announced by the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s (MAS) Equities Market Review Group in February. In particular, it plays to the S$5 billion Equity Market Development Programme unveiled by the review group.

This scheme envisages fund managers and accredited institutional investors deploying this money into small- and mid-caps which are not on any index. The same fund managers are then expected to monitor the companies into which they invest.

In short, some aspects of the market oversight and protection will now move to the realm of the investor, although SGX RegCo will retain backstop surveillance and enforcement functions.

As SGX RegCo put it in its announcement, these adjustments will strike a more “proportionate balance in facilitating market discipline and achieving investor protection”.

While the institutional and accredited investor will indeed be able to handle and monitor the market-based disclosure regime, what about the retail investors? What about the less sophisticated moms-and-pops who have sunk their hard-earned retirement savings into stocks and shares?

Their interest will be protected not just by the sophisticated institutional investors, but also SGX RegCo, whose surveillance and enforcement functions remain unchanged. But rather than regularly intervening in the market and creating unnecessary “noise”, it is envisaged that SGX RegCo will take a more targeted approach when it detects irregularities or serious breaches.

The interests of the retail investors can also be protected by the Securities Investors Association (Singapore). Since its establishment some two decades ago, SIAS has done a pretty good job as an advocate for retail investors.

But there are also other measures in place to protect small investors, such as changes to the Securities and Futures Act in 2017 which saw the strengthening of the governance and enforcement powers of MAS to safeguard the interest of retail investors.

If one were to stand back and take an objective look at the initiatives proposed (which are still subject to tweaks) from a risk-reward perspective, the positives outweigh the negatives. This market needs to rekindle the animal spirits. The chilling effect of constant and heavy-handed SGX RegCo queries simply does not allow for this.

If implemented, these measures will reduce regulatory friction that impedes price discovery and market efficiency.

There will be players who will try to game the system, but the risk of malfeasance of the John Soh variety is small. Much has been learnt and measures have been put in place over the past decade.

While the latest proposals may not be perfect in everyone's eyes, they do go some way towards bringing the disclosure regime more in line with more sophisticated markets like New York, London, Tokyo and Hong Kong. One only needs to look back at Tokyo over the past decade, where increased institutional participation coupled with a disclosure-based regime revitalised the market. Hopefully, this will be replicated in Singapore.

Taken together with other incentives and liquidity boosting measures still being rolled out by the Review Group, SGX RegCo’s proposed light-touch market-driven disclosure regime - which gives investors information to make their own decisions - could be a key catalyst for the revitalisation of the Singapore Exchange.

CNA,"Doctor fined S$10,000 over anti-Islam comments in Facebook post","SINGAPORE: A doctor who posted offensive remarks against Muslims in a social media post was fined S$10,000 (US$7,700) on Monday (May 19).

Dr Kho Kwang Po, 85, is a registered medical practitioner whose practising certificate expired on Dec 31, 2020, the Singapore Medical Council previously told CNA.

Two police reports were lodged against the Singaporean in June 2021 - one by an anonymous person who stated that Dr Kho made racist remarks on Facebook that were ""highly insulting towards Islam"".

The other person reported that Dr Kho had posted seditious content denigrating Islam on Facebook for several years.

Dr Kho, who was the only person with access to his account, first made the Facebook post on Apr 21, 2016, but reposted the same content on Apr 21, 2021, even though he had been administered a conditional warning over the original post.

His post was available for the public to see, and Dr Kho intended for the public to view it, Deputy Public Prosecutor Sean Teh told the court.

The prosecution urged the court to fine Dr Kho S$10,000, arguing that Dr Kho made the posts with some deliberation.

Mr Teh said the offence would have ordinarily warranted an imprisonment term, but the prosecution had factored in Dr Kho's advanced age, his plea of guilt to the charge of deliberately intending to wound the religious feelings of Muslims, and how the posts had not gained significant traction.

""The accused’s Facebook profile was publicly available, thus the post in question was available for all to view. In fact, the accused had been making many Muslim-directed posts over a prolonged period of time,"" said Mr Teh.

""These posts were made with deliberation: the present post is a re-post of one made five years prior, evidencing how steadfast he has been in his views.""

Dr Kho's lawyers, Kenneth Au-Yong and Josiah Tan, said their client apologised for his misjudgment.

Mr Au-Yong echoed the prosecution's points about Dr Kho's age and the limited impact of the social media posts.

""He is not likely to repeat this offence, and as the (prosecution) said, he has shown remorse and made a plea of guilt,"" said Mr Au-Yong.

District Judge Eddy Tham said he found the words ""objectively insulting"".

""As a doctor, you should have known better than to propagate such views on the internet,"" Judge Tham said.

The district judge added that he had read Dr Kho's personal plea in mitigation, expressing his remorse, where the doctor had admitted to being overly fixated on what he read on the internet, and accepting propaganda without critical examination.

Judge Tham said he hoped that Dr Kho realised the folly of his actions.

Referring to the grounds the prosecution had raised in arguing for a fine, Judge Tham agreed that a non-custodial term would be sufficient.

He imposed the maximum fine allowed under the Magistrates' Courts.

For uttering words with the deliberate intent to wound racial feelings, an offender could be jailed for up to three years, fined, or both.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/doctor-fined-anti-islam-comments-facebook-kho-kwang-po-5138746,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z
CNA,Singapore hotels raise their game as World Aquatics Championships draws near,"SINGAPORE: Ahead of an expected surge in overseas visitors in July, hotels in Singapore are taking measures such as bringing in more part-time staff and beefing up their menus.

The multi-discipline World Aquatics Championships and World Aquatics Masters Championships will be taking place then, coinciding with celebrations for Singapore’s 60th birthday.

The month-long sports event is expected to attract about 40,000 international visitors, with tourist revenue projected to hit S$60 million (US$46 million).

The World Aquatics Championships – which features the six sports of swimming, water polo, diving, artistic swimming, open water swimming and high diving – will be held from Jul 11 to Aug 3.

Parkroyal Collection Marina Bay hotel, located along Raffles Boulevard, is expected to be at full occupancy during July and August. The luxury hotel has close to 600 rooms.

Its general manager Phil Smith said such a global event means the hotel needs to ensure everyone is well prepared.

“Some of the things that we're looking at and are planning for, is obviously additional manning to help with the large amount of arrivals and departures, some of the special requests that may come in from so many international guests being in the hotel, and ensuring that our security is added to,” he told CNA.

Other measures include bringing in extra housekeeping equipment and part-time staff to turn over rooms quickly, when guests leave and new ones arrive.

The hotel is also adding dishes to its breakfast menu to keep the large and diverse crowd satisfied.

Mr Smith noted that the World Aquatics Championship – which was last held in Japan’s Fukuoka city two years ago – is “very unique” and will attract visitors who normally would not be in Singapore during that time.

“When it comes to the front office, how do we make sure that we've got people to help cope with the many different languages?” Mr Smith added.

“Some of these people coming from around the world may not speak English, and we need to ensure that we've got people to assist them.”

For boutique hotel 21 Carpenter, located in Clarke Quay close to the Singapore River, it has seen more bookings for the coming months, as compared to the same period in 2024.

“I would say that (it’s a) 7 to 8 per cent increase compared to last year,” said the hotel’s general manager Tarun Kalra.

Those who have enquired about staying there include staff from the participating nations’ sports bodies as well as supporters, he added.

“We are spending a lot of time right now to upskill our staff - give them some more skills to be able to welcome these overseas visitors that I understand are coming from more than 190 countries.”

The hotel's front office manager is also being trained to handle food and beverage services. All these will have a ripple effect to improve the hotel’s standards beyond the event, said Mr Kalra.

Singapore is the first Southeast Asian nation to host the World Aquatics Championships, with Sentosa island and the Singapore Sports Hub in Kallang being the main venues for the competition.

Some events will take place in a temporary facility in a car park next to Leisure Park Kallang Mall. Organisers are targeting an end-May completion date for this.

Singapore was picked as the host of the competition after the biennial event was relocated from the Russian city of Kazan in response to the invasion of Ukraine.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/world-aquatics-championships-hotels-surge-foreign-visitors-5139226,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z
CNA,Some Chinatown businesses see boost in sales with rejuvenation of iconic Smith Street,"SINGAPORE: Some local businesses in Chinatown are enjoying a boost in sales - of up to 40 per cent - with the rejuvenation of the iconic Smith Street and a tie-up with the refreshed Chinatown Heritage Centre.

Smith Street, located in the Chinatown conservation area, is undergoing a facelift to inject vibrancy and drive greater footfall. More tenants are currently renovating their spaces and will be opening within the next few months.

But shop owners told CNA that various challenges remain with rising rental and labour shortage.

Elegance of Nanyang, which sells and rents out kebayas, is among the new shops on Smith Street.

Ms Yu Guangning, the boutique’s owner and director, said that while she wants to share the local heritage and the art of kebayas with tourists, she faces several challenges including steep rental costs.

“In this location, definitely (rental) is not going to be low. Subsequently, for us, manpower is a challenge. And you need to keep up to have new products, attract staff, to really attract tourists to come to Chinatown,” she added.

To help heritage business owners like her, the Chinatown Heritage Centre has in place a series of initiatives to appeal to tourists, including marketing efforts with some of these brands.

“For many of these smaller brands, they may not have the resources or focus as much,” said Cai Yinzhou, executive director of the Chinatown Heritage Centre.

“So we hope to do that with our promotional campaigns with some of these brands and shops, where visitors to our centre with a ticket can enjoy discounts and get subsidised products when they visit these shops.”

Another shop on Smith Street, Killiney Kopitiam, is reaping the fruits of the collaboration.

Since its opening in March, the traditional coffee shop has seen a 40 per cent rise in sales.

Mr Henry Oh, general manager of Killiney International, said: “By participating in their programmes, we get the community and the tourists to know that we are actually here.”

The business owners are also working closely with the Chinatown Business Association, and have urged other heritage shops to do the same.

Ms Yu said: “They organise some workshops for us, to basically let us have a better understanding of the current status of Chinatown as well as to give us some training in social media programmes - so that we are not doing only in the retail shop, but we can also do something online to really make Smith Street popular.”

Mr Oh added: “Heritage is something that if you don’t preserve, once you lose it, you lose it forever. So it’s very important that we preserve our history and our heritage.”

The association told CNA that its aim is for Smith Street to serve as the “cultural heart” of Chinatown, “where culinary delights, art and experiences converge, offering visitors a diverse cultural dining and experience in a setting that inspires joy and excitement”.

Ms Lim Yick Suan, executive director of Chinatown Business Association, said one of its key roles is to promote the interests of its community stakeholders, including heritage businesses.

For instance, it often encourages collaborations between traditional businesses and newer entrants to attract customers, she said.

“We actively work to support these businesses by promoting collaborations, encouraging footfall through events and experiences, and connecting them with relevant partners and resources to stay competitive,” she added.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/chinatown-rejunvenate-smith-street-cultural-historical-heritage-businesses-rental-manpower-5139211,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z
CNA,Lady Gaga concert in Singapore: A theatrical masterpiece,"On Sunday night (May 18), Mother Monster made her grand return to Singapore with the first of her four Asia-exclusive shows at Singapore’s National Stadium. Lion City Mayhem was Lady Gaga’s first reunion with Little Monsters here in 13 years, and anticipation was high even before the start of the show as fans roused each other, throwing the venue into thunderous applause.

The concert kicked off in grand fashion at about 8.15pm, with Lady Gaga wheeling in atop a towering cage filled with dancers as she launched into Bloody Mary.

It is the kind of ostentatious display fans have come to expect – and love.

In fact, I would go so far as to say that Lion City Mayhem was not a concert; it was a polished theatrical production that spotlighted the 39-year-old’s monumental growth as an artiste – one who is now also a respected actress and an Academy Award winner.

Set in five acts, Lion City Mayhem was, at its core, a gothic opera that used Lady Gaga’s repertoire of songs to further its plot, as opposed to being a “Night Of Lady Gaga’s Best Hits”.

Lady Gaga Lion City Mayhem in Singapore setlist:

Bloody Mary
Abracadabra
Judas
Scheiße
Garden Of Eden
Poker Face
Perfect Celebrity
Disease
Paparazzi
Alejandro
The Beast
Killah
Zombieboy
Die With A Smile
How Bad Do U Want Me
Shadow of A Man
Born This Way
Blade Of Grass
Shallow
Vanish Into You
Bad Romance

The result was 120 minutes of Gaga continuously upping the ante, delivering captivating performances amidst haunting set pieces.

Despite the theatrical-esque production, Lady Gaga still managed to set aside a small section of her show to interact with fans during the song Vanish Into You, which proved to be one of the night's highlights.

Seeing fans of different nationalities burst into tears just by being in the presence of Lady Gaga was a testament to the impact she's had in the world and in pop culture.

Conversely, the gothic set-up also led to a few unwittingly funny moments like her singing the power ballad Die With A Smile – one of the most romantic songs in modern history – dressed as a devil playing a piano, blanketed with human skulls.

But hey, that’s Gaga for you.

While Lady Gaga and the production itself scored full marks in my book, I would be remiss if I didn’t warn potential attendees, especially those seated in the floor section, that due to the relatively small stage size, you’ll pretty much have to stand throughout the entire show just to see what’s going on on stage.

And even then, be prepared to have your view blocked by a sea of phones. Which, of course, isn’t due to any fault of Gaga herself. But just be mentally prepared to stare at the giant screens throughout the show.

All in all, Lion City Mayhem was a reassurance that despite Lady Gaga’s numerous achievements, she is still who she is at heart: A monster performer.

Lady Gaga will perform three more shows in Singapore – May 19, 21 and 24.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/lady-gaga-singapore-concert-2025-review-5138626,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z
CNA,"'This is not the time to judge': Meet the woman behind Babes, a support group for pregnant teens in Singapore","Every year, Babes Pregnancy Crisis Support receives over 600 enquiries to its 24/7 telephone hotline and WhatsApp service. The organisation helps pregnant teens – the girls who get pregnant and the boys who got someone pregnant – navigate an unplanned pregnancy.

One of those calls was from Vanessa.

The young woman, who did not want to reveal her full name, was in her late teens when she found out she was pregnant. Her abusive boyfriend then tried to force her to get an abortion.

Even though she eventually found the courage to leave him, there were other struggles. She had a strained relationship with her mother, and having left school, found it difficult to find a job and support herself financially while pregnant.

She toyed with the idea of terminating the pregnancy, but when she heard her baby’s heartbeat during her first ultrasound, she made a decision – she would raise her daughter.

Thankfully, she wasn’t truly alone. After reaching out to a Family Service Centre, Vanessa was referred to Babes.

The organisation helped her prepare for childbirth, gave her essentials like a stroller, diapers, and a cot, and even helped her secure a job. Even now, her case worker continues to support the single mum as she raises her daughter.

It’s stories like Vanessa’s that keep Sophie Mathur going. As the chairperson of Babes, Mathur hears accounts like this almost daily from her team. It reminds her of why the work matters.

Babes started in 2005 under Beyond Social Services, a non-profit that supports children and youth from disadvantaged backgrounds in Singapore.

As it does now, the crisis support organisation served teens with unplanned pregnancies. They lend a hand to anyone relevant to the cause, whether it’s the girl who got pregnant, the boy who discovers he made someone pregnant, or the concerned but lost parent who finds out their child is pregnant.

In 2013, Babes became an independent organisation. Mathur was appointed its chairperson in 2019, but she had long been a vocal advocate.

“This space is large but overlooked,” said Mathur, who is also a corporate partner at global law firm Linklaters. “Not many people realise how many young women in Singapore face unplanned pregnancies and how hard it is to find support when they do.”

According to the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority’s 2022 report on births and deaths in Singapore, 218 babies were born to mothers aged 19 and younger. In comparison, 487 babies were born to this group in 2013.

A study by SingHealth in November 2024 found a 60 per cent increase in the number of Singapore women seeking abortion referrals at its eight polyclinics, between 2017 and 2020. Most of these women were under 20, and over 10 per cent were repeat referrals.

“Babes provides support to teenage mums at every stage,” said Mathur, who is in her forties.

Its mission is to help pregnant teens and their families work towards the “best possible future”, whether it’s choosing motherhood, terminating the pregnancy, or putting the baby up for adoption.

“From the moment she finds out she’s pregnant and doesn’t know what to do, to walking her through an abortion if she decides to have one, to when they’ve just given birth and are dealing with postpartum issues, to even if she has another unplanned pregnancy and changes her mind about keeping the baby.

“We even guide teenage boys who are so lost or anxious after knowing they got someone pregnant – we walk with them through it all.”

To do this, Babes operates on two main pillars.

“The first pillar is direct support,” Mathur told CNA Women. This includes the 24/7 helpline and WhatsApp service, as well as the dedicated work of full-time case workers and volunteers.

If a teen finds out she’s pregnant or if he has made someone pregnant, they can reach out to Babes’ 24/7 service. Helpline volunteers are trained to listen without judgement or criticism.

More importantly, they’re there to guide the teen through different options so they can make informed decisions based on their situation.

Mathur highlighted the contributions of Spradha Sinha, Babes’ lead helpline volunteer, who oversees a team of around 30 helpline volunteers. In all, they clock more than 1,000 hours of calls each year.

For her work in Babes, Sinha was a finalist in the 2023 Singapore Silent Heroes Awards, given by the Civilians Association (Singapore) to honour those who make unseen contributions to the community.

Case workers like Haslinda So’od and Fatimah Abdul Karim also play a key role in helping each pregnant teen navigate her unique circumstances, right down to the smallest detail,  to help her feel safe, empowered and supported. That can include figuring out where to get affordable baby clothes and learning how to breastfeed.

“The second pillar focuses on upstream work,” Mathur said, referring to efforts like teen pregnancy prevention campaigns, and social media work that focuses on education surrounding relationships, contraception and decision-making.

In addition to talks at junior colleges and polytechnics, Babes also runs workshops with partners like the Girl Guides. On its office tours at local companies and at networking events, the girls get to meet people from various industries and hear their personal stories.

“The tours show the girls that despite any setback or growing up in difficult circumstances, there are different paths towards success and they can still build a meaningful future for themselves.”

Some fundraising efforts double as empowerment initiatives, including offering henna art services, or selling handcrafted items like candles, made by women who have used Babes’ services, at markets like Boutique Fairs Singapore.

Mathur grew emotional when she shared why Babes matters so much to her. While some critics of the organisation may mean well, she believes their concerns are often misplaced and laced with judgement instead of compassion.

“When I had my first pregnancy, I was 38. It was twins, and I was terrified,” said Mathur. “ I had so many things – a stable job, financial security, a supportive husband and family, and I was so used to speaking with doctors who also respect me. So if I could feel scared, how must a teenage girl feel when she has none of that?”

That’s why Babes exists, the mum of three said. Not to encourage teen pregnancy, but to support girls when they’re at their most vulnerable.

Mathur said: “What kind of society do you want to live in? Do we want to build one that’s harsh and punishes us for every mistake we make? Or one that’s more compassionate and picks us up when we’re down?”

She noted that some teens only come to Babes after a second unplanned pregnancy, not because they didn’t learn the first time, but because they had no support then.

“The deed is done, the girl is pregnant, and she needs help,” Mathur said. “This is not the time to judge, it’s the time to show up for her and her family.”

“Teens are often misunderstood,” Mathur said. “Their brains are still developing. When they, especially those at risk, act out or make poor decisions, we call them stupid or reckless – but many of them are already dealing with a lot.”

Whenever critics question why Babes is needed, Mathur remembers something Sinha shared with her.

“She told me, ‘What if this were my daughter? These girls have nowhere to go, no one to turn to. So let me be that person for all of these girls, these daughters.'”

Mathur added: “I want to make sure these daughters are never alone.”

Mathur said her legal training has taught her to leave assumptions at the door. “I don’t walk into a situation thinking I know everything,” she said. “And that’s so important at Babes, where every girl and every family has their own story. You can’t judge before you’ve even listened.”

It’s why stories like Vanessa’s move Mathur and allow her to learn more about the different challenges faced by young girls seeking help, especially after what seems to be a terrible mistake.

“The moment we hear of a teen, especially if that teen is someone we know, getting pregnant, we may think we know what’s best for her,” Mathur said. “But if I don’t know the full story, how can I ever begin to know?”

“Working with these amazing women and men on the Babes team and learning about the dozens of girls we have the privilege to help – it personally makes me more empathetic, more grounded,” Mathur said.

Reach out to Babes on Instagram, their telephone helpline at 6206 6641, or WhatsApp at 8111 3535.

CNA,"Chee Soon Juan calls for reforms to electoral system, says SDP will not retreat despite GE2025 losses","SINGAPORE: Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) chief Chee Soon Juan reiterated his call for electoral reforms on Sunday (May 18), in his first public remarks since the party's losses at the 2025 General Election.

""Rather than retreating, what we're going to be doing is embarking on this renew, rebuild, reignite campaign,"" he told reporters ahead of an appreciation dinner for SDP members.

The opposition party lost in all four constituencies it contested in the election.

Dr Chee narrowly missed out on becoming a Non-Constituency Member of Parliament after obtaining 46.82 per cent of the vote in Sembawang West SMC.

The straight fight between Mr Chee and Ms Poh Li San of the People’s Action Party (PAP) was the third-closest contest of the election.

On Sunday, Dr Chee outlined three major initiatives that the party would be working on, the first of which was an online petition on electoral reforms.

The petition highlighted six ""urgent and meaningful"" changes that would ensure Singapore's political system ""reflects the highest standards of transparency, accountability and democratic integrity"".

It called for the Elections Department to be removed from the Prime Minister's Office, to ""end gerrymandering"" and abolish the Group Representation Constituency (GRC) system.

The petition also said there should be a minimum three-week campaign period, a six-month gap between the announcement of new electoral boundaries and the dissolution of parliament, and a review of the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act in Singapore to allow media to be free and independent.

Dr Chee said this year's polls were ""very much a smash-and-grab election"" by the ruling PAP.

""This whole campaign was just conducted in unseemly haste,"" he said.

He added that the electorate hardly had time to grasp the ""weighty"" national concerns that affect Singapore's society before Polling Day arrived.

""This has been the feedback we've been getting over and over, especially if you're talking about younger voters,"" he said. By the time the voters start getting involved, they are ""being pushed"" to make decisions.

Dr Chee emphasised that the petition is a ""non-partisan effort"".

""They are foundational principles of good governance and democratic integrity,"" he wrote on Change.org. ""Singapore is ready to take the next step forward in its political maturity by ensuring our elections are genuinely free and fair.""

SDP chairman Paul Tambyah said the online petition is just a starting point, and could develop into legal challenges.

""Hopefully we'll be able to sustain this momentum,"" he said, adding that the party is taking a multi-prong approach to the next five years.

The second initiative that the SDP announced is the Orange and Teal Social Enterprise Co-operative, which aims to create a ""people-centric economic counterweight to the PAP-NTUC nexus"".

Dr Chee said the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) has ""lost its way"", but that Singapore has been ""dominated"" by the PAP and NTUC.

He said the co-operative is meant to operate from the ground up and will aim to offer fair-wage employment, compared to the top-down approach taken by the ruling party and the labour movement.

""We're looking for Singaporeans to own a part of this business,"" he said. Those who register as members will pay a S$100 (US$77) fee.

Its website said the co-operative wants to empower workers, freelancers, creatives, and small businesses in Singapore through shared ownership, community-driven innovation, and inclusive employment opportunities.

SDP also said it has seen an upsurge in interest from young people who want to be involved in the political process.

""We're going to tap into it,"" said Dr Chee, adding that some younger voters find the political process to be unsatisfactory.

The party attributed part of the increased interest to TikTok and memes that caught the attention of voters.

""One thing that's been quite interesting that we have seen is that many young people, even people who are too young to vote, have been coming forward, expressing an interest,"" said Mr Ariffin Sha, who was part of an SDP team that contested Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC.

Many people felt that the election was too rushed and felt an ""innate sense of injustice"" when Bukit Batok SMC was ""wiped off the map"", he added.

Young Democrat representative Shawal Yeo said he hoped the party could direct the energy of the young people in a constructive way. ""Don't get angry, get active,"" he said.

Dr Tambyah said that at a training event held this weekend, many participants described themselves as previously ""politically apathetic"" and were in a political party office for the first time.

""There was a certain amount of fear that was in there, but it's this transformation from fear to hope, which is what we hope to do within the next five years,"" he said.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/sdp-chee-soon-juan-campaign-electoral-reform-5137741,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z
CNA,Work It Podcast: Retrenched? Here’s how the new jobs support scheme can help you,"The recently launched SkillsFuture Jobseeker Support Scheme aims to help those who have been retrenched with tiered monthly cash payments.

Lynn Ng, assistant chief executive of Workforce Singapore, explains how to tap into the scheme.

Here's an excerpt from the conversation:

Gerald Tan, host:
One of the things that I often face when I share about the (SkillsFuture Jobseeker Support) Scheme with our podcast guests, (they will) say: “I don't qualify because my salary is beyond that S$5,000 mark.”

But I know of some other people who said: “You know what? I feel like I've been involuntarily let go, but it was not official.”

They were maybe asked to quit, or were told of the (retrenchment), and then they were given the option to resign on their own because they said that the company is not doing well ... And then they did that, (but) they don't have that official retrenchment letter per se.

So for these groups of people, would there be a possibility that the scheme could include such cases in future or even now?

Lynn Ng, assistant chief executive of Workforce Singapore (WSG):
So Gerald has pointed out a very key implementation issue that we face as well, which is that some individuals are unable to show proof that they have been involuntarily let go.

For example, their contract was terminated, it was not renewed by the employer, even though the employer had promised that the contract would be renewed. So in these instances, we are very flexible in our implementation, even if there is no official letter.

It can also be a conversation that they have had with the HR, which they said had taken place. And if they provide us with the details of the HR or supervisor whom they have spoken with, we could do a verification with them that it was indeed the intent of the individual to stay on, but the company could not continue to provide the employment. Yes, we would accept the individual into the scheme.

So we are very flexible with it. We are fully aware that there are practical challenges and official letters are not always possible to get. But the basic requirements that we will need is some form of contact from the applicant about who we can verify the information with.

CNA,"Stoppage time heartbreak as Lion City Sailors fall to Sharjah, miss out on AFC Champions League Two title","SINGAPORE: The Lion City Sailors' fairytale voyage came to a heartbreaking end on Sunday (May 18) after they lost to United Arab Emirates side Sharjah in the AFC Champions League Two (ACL2) final.

A Marcus Meloni goal in the seventh minute of stoppage time was enough to give the away side a 2-1 victory at a packed Bishan Stadium, and dash the Sailors' hopes of being the first local club side to win a continental title.

Firas Ben Larbi had earlier put the Emirati side ahead in the 74th minute before the Sailors' Maxime Lestienne levelled the tie in the first minute of stoppage time.

The Sailors had overcome considerable odds and several top sides, such as Japan's Sanfrecce Hiroshima and Australia's Sydney FC, to reach the final.



They were crowned Singapore Premier League champions on Saturday and can still complete a domestic double should they lift the Singapore Cup, where they are slated to face Brunei DPMM in the semi-finals.

Sharjah are second in the UAE Pro League. They beat Saudi Pro League side Al-Taawoun 2-1 on aggregate to book their spot in Sunday's decider.

The away side first had the ball in the back of the net after 10 minutes, but Caio Lucas was offside.

The Sailors had their first clear-cut chance minutes later, as a Bart Ramselaar shot was deflected over. A goalmouth melee from the corner resulted in the ball being desperately hacked away.

It was the lively Caio Lucas who was the main threat for Sharjah, and he almost got a shot off minutes later, but Bailey Wright came to the rescue with a superb block.

Sailors full-back Diogo Costa came the closest in the 34th minute, but his effort rattled the post with the Sharjah goalkeeper Adel Al-Hosani beaten.

While the away side were slow to emerge from the dressing room after the interval, they were quicker off the blocks in the second half as Caio Lucas smashed a shot into the side netting in the 52nd minute.

The Sailors were by no means out of this one and were even closer about ten minutes later, but Ramselaar ballooned an effort from close range.

Momentum was now fully with the away side as they dominated possession and put the ball past Izwan for the second time via Ben Larbi, but the offside flag was up.

And they got their reward minutes later as Ben Larbi ghosted in to score and cap off a flowing move.

Despite the setback, the Sailors were not giving up.

As they threw everything forward, they grabbed a stunning equaliser courtesy of Lestienne, who swept home a Diogo Costa cross to send most of the 9,737-strong crowd into raptures.

But just as the Singapore side thought they had dragged the game into extra time, Sharjah's Meloni popped up with the winner to break hearts.

Caio Lucas found him, and he cut inside and curled home to silence most of the stadium – but not the small section of ecstatic away fans.

Speaking to the media after the game, the Sailors' head coach Aleksandar Rankovic praised his side's efforts.

""Our guys did a tremendous job, especially after going 1-0 down,"" he said. ""It was a shame that we (conceded) a very late 2-1 goal, but I have nothing to say except that I am very, very proud of my boys.""

Prior to the final, Sharjah had expressed reservations about the decider being hosted at the Jalan Besar Stadium, claiming that it ""does not meet the aspirations of the fans and stakeholders"".

The 55,000-seater National Stadium was ruled out as a venue as it had been booked well in advance for Lady Gaga's Lion City Mayhem concerts on May 18, 19, 21 and 24.

This meant that the final was played at Bishan Stadium with improvements undertaken, such as the building of three new stands to increase its capacity by more than three times to accommodate about 10,000 spectators.

The Sailors booked their place in the final after beating Australia's Sydney FC 2-1 over two legs. In the quarters, the Singaporean side beat Sanfrecce Hiroshima 4-1 on aggregate.

All seemed lost for the Sailors after they lost to the Japanese giants in the first leg of the quarter-finals 6-1.

But the result was later chalked off, and they were awarded a 3-0 win by the Asian footballing body, as Sanfrecce had fielded a player who was supposed to be serving a three-match suspension.

The Sailors then registered a 1-1 draw in the second leg at home.

Previously known as the AFC Cup, the ACL2 is the second-tier Asian club football tournament with a revamped format.
The last time a Singapore side reached the knockout stages of an AFC club competition was in 2018, when Home United, as the Sailors were previously known, got as far as the inter-zone semi-finals in that year's edition of the AFC Cup.

""The number one lesson is that you should never stop dreaming and believing,"" Rankovic said of his side, who had been outsiders to make it this far.

CNA,Commentary: China is testing Trump in the South China Sea and the region is watching,"LANCASTER, England: On Apr 25, Chinese state TV made an unusual announcement: The coast guard had “implemented maritime control” at Sandy Cay in the Spratly Islands, with images showing the national flag unfurled on the uninhabited sandbar.

The Philippines hurriedly dispatched a team to take similar photos to show it remained unoccupied.

The landing on the atoll, and the publicity given to it, drove home one of Beijing’s core messages to the region this year – the prospect of abandonment by an unreliable US administration.

China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, made this clear in March. At his high-profile press conference during the annual Two Sessions in Beijing, he warned that “infringement and provocation will backfire, and those acting as others’ chess pieces are bound to be discarded”.

In case anyone had missed the point, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a standalone statement highlighting Mr Wang’s comments. Official comments have repeated the line ever since.

The Sandy Cay incident was typical of China’s efforts to place US commitment in the Indo-Pacific under the microscope. The sandbar is within plain sight of the Philippines’ main military outpost in the hotly disputed archipelago.

Beijing’s information release was also carefully timed – the American and Philippine militaries were conducting their annual Balikatan joint exercises in the South China Sea.

Meanwhile, US freedom of navigation operations (FONOPs) in the South China Sea appear to have once again been paused, as they were in 2017, against the backdrop of a US-China trade war where deals are expected to be made.

US President Donald Trump’s first term coincided with a lull in South China Sea tensions as the Philippines under then-President Rodrigo Duterte sought to attract Chinese economic assistance, while Beijing restrained its maritime agencies in the hopes of peeling away a US ally.

As a result, Trump’s commitment to the US’ key Southeast Asian ally was not seriously tested by events on the water. The situation in his second term is very different.

On Jan 24, a scientific team from the Philippine Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources abandoned a survey at Sandy Cay.

Videos released by the Philippines showed a Chinese Coast Guard ship blocking Philippine survey vessels and a military helicopter hovering at low altitude. China described its vessels as having “intercepted, controlled, warned and expelled” intruding Philippine ships from the area, and state media drew attention to the incident.

That was four days after Mr Trump’s inauguration and new Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s reaffirmation of the United States-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty and the US’ “ironclad commitments” to the Philippines.

An even more dangerous encounter followed on Feb 19 near Scarborough Shoal, when a Chinese helicopter flew within 3m of a Philippine patrol aircraft near Scarborough Shoal, according to the Philippine Coast Guard.

Then there’s the matter of the Chinese Coast Guard ships’ lingering presence in the Philippines Exclusive Economic Zone between Scarborough Shoal and the coast of northern Luzon since January. The area, while inside Beijing’s nine-dash line, is well over 100km from any disputed territory.

March and April saw Beijing and Manila trading accusations after incidents in the air and at sea near Scarborough Shoal.

The Philippines’ maritime agencies are outmatched by the Chinese Coast Guard, which is the world’s largest white-hull force (as opposed to the “grey hulls” of the navy). Yet unlike in Duterte’s term, Philippine agencies are contesting Chinese activities and publicising incidents, citing President Ferdinand Marcos Jr’s commitment that “not a square inch of Philippine territory is surrendered to any foreign power”.

American FONOPs in the South China Sea are part of the calculus. They challenge China’s extra-legal claims in the South China Sea, by asserting navigation rights and sailing military vessels in disputed waters.

In 2017, the first Trump administration placed the existing FONOP programme on hold while the president sought to build a relationship with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping.

At the time of writing, there have been no publicly reported FONOP in the South China Sea since Dec 6, 2024.

More frequent and visible assertions of presence and navigation by other states will be needed if the waterway is to remain international. There have been some signs that some may be willing to step up.

During a visit to Manila in March, British Foreign Secretary David Lammy released a video on social media asserting the United Kingdom’s interests in the South China Sea, emphasising its commitment to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) – which the United States has not ratified – and criticising “dangerous and destabilising activities by China.”

If clashes continue, so do the odds of escalation, whether by intent or miscalculation.

The region must be prepared for potential serious incidents involving vessel damage or even casualties, and an unpredictable US response. Advanced US anti-ship missiles were deployed to the Philippines for the first time, during this year’s Balikatan drill.

Yet to deal with the problem at hand, the Philippines needs to expand its navy and civilian maritime law enforcement assets. Given Mr Trump’s struggles to boost US shipbuilding capacity, it seems unlikely Washington will be of much help in this regard.

Japan, South Korea and Australia are more likely partners. Each may view increased Philippine capability in the South China Sea as potential brake on Beijing’s strategic advances elsewhere in the region.

One other option is to bring the issue to the UN General Assembly (UNGA) via a resolution calling on China to comply with the 2016 arbitration ruling under UNCLOS.

While non-binding, a UNGA resolution could rally international attention and support and, as think tank CSIS’ Greg Poling has pointed out, could point the way to an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice (ICJ).

Abandonment is not the only extreme policy risk that countries in the region need to think through. Under Mr Trump, the spectrum of Washington’s responses to such situations could range from acquiescence and non-involvement to reckless escalation.

Many US allies in the Indo-Pacific are understandably worried that they may become the next Ukraine – lectured and pressured into submission by their own ally.

The region needs to think through how to respond to maritime crises and forestall extreme scenarios that have become less remote possibilities.

CNA,"China fully respects Denmark's sovereignty on Greenland, foreign minister says","BEIJING: China fully respects Denmark's sovereignty and territorial integrity on the Greenland issue, Foreign Minister Wang Yi told his Danish counterpart on Monday (May 19), urging the European nation to reciprocate over China's own sovereignty concerns.

United States President Donald Trump has in recent months insisted that Washington should take over the strategically located, semi-autonomous Danish territory.

Beijing hopes Denmark will ""continue to support China's legitimate position on issues concerning China's sovereignty and territorial integrity"", Wang told Denmark's Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen in Beijing on Monday, according to a ministry statement.

The meeting took place after Beijing criticised Denmark for hosting former Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen last week, who met Danish lawmakers and gave a speech at a democracy summit in Copenhagen.



China claims democratically-governed Taiwan as its own territory. Taiwan's government rejects Beijing's sovereignty claim.

Ties between China and Denmark are challenged by the latter's informal relations with Taiwan and hit a low point in 2009 when the Dalai Lama visited Copenhagen.

But relations improved after Denmark accepted China's offer of two pandas as part of its so-called ""panda diplomacy"".

Both countries' cooperation has a large focus on green solutions, with Denmark's expertise in wind power and environmental solutions matching China's appetite for the green transition.

China is willing to deepen economic and trade cooperation with Denmark, as well as cooperation in scientific innovation and the green economy, Wang told Rasmussen.

The two sides share a widespread consensus on safeguarding multilateralism and defending free trade, he said, adding that China is willing to strengthen dialogue and cooperation with the EU.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/east-asia/china-fully-respects-denmark-greenland-sovereignty-5139111,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z
CNA,Nvidia's Huang sparks 'Jensanity' in Taiwan with AI hero's welcome,"TAIPEI: Wherever AI darling Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang goes in Taiwan, his adoring fans and excited reporters follow, hanging on his every word, arms outstretched as they beseech him to sign books, posters and even baseballs.

Huang, born in Taiwan's historic capital of Tainan before migrating to the United States when he was nine, is visiting Taipei this week for the annual Computex trade show, and his every move has been watched since his private jet touched down on Friday afternoon.

""Jensen I love you!"" one woman shouted out to him from the crowd in English as he greeted a throng in front of a Taipei restaurant on Saturday (May 17) night where he was entertaining Taiwanese tech titans from companies like chipmaker TSMC, dubbed by local media the ""trillion dollar dinner"" given the market capitalisation of the assembled firms.

""I love coming to Taiwan and love seeing everybody here and I appreciate their support, and everybody's very, very kind,"" Huang told Reuters when asked about the wildly enthusiastic reception he gets in Taiwan.

Visiting Taipei for Computex last year, some Taiwanese media termed the expression ""Jensanity"" to describe the level of devotion he generates when he visits.

This year, Nvidia has set up a pop-up store selling playing cards, shirts and other memorabilia with Huang's image on it.

His fame in Taiwan prompts bafflement from Nvidia colleagues, given he is often largely unnoticed when he attends similar events in the United States, and concern from his bodyguards as they try to hold back reporters and fans alike.

""He's not saying anything important,"" one bodyguard told reporters, asking them to step back as Huang handed out fried ice cream to his gathered fans on Saturday night outside the restaurant, where he and his guests enjoyed rice noodle soup and Taiwan's award-winning Kavalan whisky.

""He has encouraged Taiwanese young people like myself. I believe what he is doing is something we should learn from,"" said 21-year-old student Hsu Han-yun, who got Huang's autograph outside the restaurant.

After finishing the dinner, Huang rushed off to the opening ceremony of the World Masters Games, an Olympics adjacent event for athletes mostly over 30, where he was a guest of honour along with Olympics gold medalist boxer Lin Yu-ting and renowned Taiwanese actor and director Sylvia Chang.

Huang's participation even briefly embroiled Taiwan's presidential office, after criticism from opposition politicians that Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim was only making a last-minute appearance to ""freeload"" on Huang also being there.

When Hsiao confirmed she was going she did not know Huang would also be doing so, and in any case the presidential security detail had checked out the venue a month ago, her office said in a statement.

Given the intensity and breathlessness of the Taiwanese media coverage, at least one government department weighed in over the weekend to set the record straight on one issue - how much it costs to park his Bombardier private jet at Taipei's downtown Songshan airport.

Taiwan's transport ministry said it would be NT$95,562 (US$3,167) assuming he was staying for six days - following local media reports as to the cost and length of stay.

""The number reported in the media of more than NT$60,000 is wrong, (nobody asked the Civil Aviation Administration or the airport, and the source of this is unclear),"" it added, in a slightly indignant tone.

In the end, the aircraft, operated by executive aircraft charter operator VistaJet, left Taipei on Saturday afternoon to fly to Honolulu, according to flight tracking apps.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/nvidia-jensen-huang-taiwan-heros-welcome-5139061,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z
CNA,China's Xiaomi to invest nearly US$7 billion in chips,"BEIJING: Chinese tech giant Xiaomi will invest 50 billion yuan (US$6.9 billion) in developing high-end smartphone chips, the firm's founder said on Monday (May 19).

Xiaomi, which sells goods from smartphones to vacuum cleaners and EVs, is one of China's most prominent consumer electronics firms.

Writing on social media platform WeChat to mark the 15th year since the company's establishment, Lei Jun - who is also the company's CEO - said ""chips are the underlying core track for Xiaomi to break through in cutting-edge technology, so we will definitely make an all-out effort"".

In pursuit of Xiaomi's semiconductor ambitions, the firm has developed an investment plan involving ""at least 10 years of investment and at least 50 billion yuan"", Lei added.



Xiaomi took initial steps into semiconductors for smartphones with the launch of the firm's first in-house chip - the Surge S1 - in 2017.

But the group was forced to halt production of the chip due to technical and financial obstacles, and has since refocused on other components as well as a move into the electric vehicle sector.

""That is not our 'dark history'. That is the path we have travelled,"" wrote Lei on Monday.

Since 2021, Xiaomi's chip development program has already received 13.5 billion yuan in research and development funds for a team of more than 2,500 employees, said the billionaire entrepreneur.

The announcement comes in the face of heightened technological tensions between Beijing and Washington as both nations seek to ensure access to the most advanced components.

A number of Chinese firms are racing to develop their own chips with the aim of freeing themselves from reliance on foreign suppliers in the face of that rivalry.

""Xiaomi has always had a 'chip dream',"" Lei wrote, adding: ""I earnestly request everyone to give us more time and patience to support our continued exploration on this road.""

In a separate Weibo post, Lei also announced Xiaomi will launch its highly anticipated YU7 electric sports utility vehicle alongside other products on Thursday.

These include the Xring O1 mobile chip and new Xiaomi 15S Pro smartphone.

Analysts have touted the YU7 as a challenger to Tesla's best-selling Model Y in China, the world's largest auto market, and Xiaomi had disappointed fans last month by not showcasing the car at the Shanghai auto show.

Xiaomi began manufacturing EVs last year with the launch of the SU7 sedan after selling smartphones, household appliances and smart gadgets for most of its 15-year history. Since December, the SU7 sedan has outsold Tesla's Model 3 on a monthly basis.

Analysts say it is still outselling, but the company's orders for its SU7 sedan have fallen following a fatal accident in March involving an SU7.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/east-asia/xiaomi-invest-7-billion-smartphone-chips-china-yu7-ev-5138876,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z
CNA,Japan's 7-Eleven trials autonomous delivery robots,"TOKYO: Japan's 7-Eleven began trialling autonomous delivery robots in a Tokyo suburb for the first time on Monday (May 19) to test their viability in the rapidly ageing country.

The country faces growing labour shortages and changed its traffic laws in 2023 to allow delivery robots on public streets. Other companies, including Panasonic, have also tested new machines to transport goods.

The pilot project by 7-Eleven involves a wheeled, cart-shaped robot co-developed by leading automaker Suzuki and Tokyo-based start-up Lomby and covered around 10,000 households in western Tokyo.

The convenience store giant has trialled similar robots remotely manoeuvered by humans but this was the first trial of self-driving machines on public pavements.



Orders placed on a smartphone app activate the robot, sending it gliding unmanned towards the specified home address at 6 kmh.

The robots can recognise traffic signals and other signs on public roads, although they are monitored remotely by human operators who can intervene in the event of an emergency.

""If, for example, the robot is surrounded by people and finds itself at a loss, the operator can ask them through a microphone to please let it come through,"" a spokesperson for parent company Seven & i Holding told AFP.

The trial is slated to run until February and the machines are meant to help sustain 7-Eleven's existing delivery service that relies on human drivers.

""In five years' time when the labour shortage can further deepen, there is no guarantee that human deliveries will remain viable till then,"" the spokesperson said.

""We have to be prepared.""

The neighbourhood chosen for the trial, Minami-Osawa in Tokyo, sits on a hill with many slopes and stairs, difficult topography for many of its ageing residents.

The trial will assess whether autonomous delivery robots can be a shopping solution for such areas, the firm said in a statement.

Publications including Business Insider have reported that a similar trial was conducted by 7-Eleven in Los Angeles in 2023.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/east-asia/japan-7-eleven-trials-autonomous-delivery-robots-ageing-population-5139526,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z
CNA,"Heavy rains kill 5 in China's south, authorities issue disaster alerts","HONG KONG: Heavy rains in China's southern Guangdong and Guangxi provinces killed five people and left several missing over the weekend as authorities issued alerts for severe rain, mountain flooding and geological disasters in the south of the country.

China's National Meteorological Centre issued multiple warnings over the weekend of heavy rains in areas of Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangxi, Guangdong and the northwestern province of Xinjiang from Sunday (May 18) to Monday, said the official Xinhua news agency.

A yellow alert was issued in parts of Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong and Guangxi, indicating a relatively high risk of mountain flooding, Xinhua said.

China has a four-tier weather warning system with red representing the most severe warning, followed by orange, yellow and blue.

Chinese meteorological data shows 2024 was the warmest year for the country since comparable records began more than six decades ago, the second straight year in which milestones were broken.

Last year's warmer weather was accompanied by stronger storms and higher rainfall and led to spikes in power consumption in the world's second-largest economy.

State broadcaster CCTV said heavy rain was also expected from Monday to Tuesday in areas including the far western region of Xinjiang along the Tianshan Mountains.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/east-asia/china-heavy-rains-kill-five-disaster-alerts-5138601,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z
CNA,Indonesia raises alert to highest level for Lewotobi Laki-laki volcano,"JAKARTA: Indonesia raised the alert level of Mount Lewotobi Laki-laki to the highest after it erupted eight times over the weekend, its volcanology agency has said.

Lewotobi Laki-laki, located on Flores island in eastern Indonesia, spewed volcanic ash between 3km to 5.5km high on Sunday (May 18), Muhammad Wafid, the agency's head said in a statement late on Sunday.

""Our analysis showed that the activities of Mount Lewotobi Laki-laki are still high so we raised the status level starting on Sunday at 8pm,"" he said.

Images shared by the agency showed clouds of thick grey ash billowing from the crater. Rumbling noises with low to high intensity were heard from the nearest monitoring post during the eruption, Wafid added.



On Monday morning, the volcano erupted again, belching 1.2km high ash clouds.

The agency said a 6km radius from the crater must be cleared and warned the residents of the risk of cold lava flow from the crater once heavy rains take place.

There has not been any evacuation of residents or flight cancellations due to the eruptions so far, said Heronimus Lamawuran, a local government official.

In March, an eruption at Lewotobi Laki-laki forced some airlines to cancel and delay flights into Bali, including Australia's Jetstar and Qantas Airways.

At least nine people were killed and thousands were evacuated when the volcano erupted in November last year.

CNA,Landslide at gold mine in Indonesia's Papua kills six; 14 missing,"JAKARTA: Torrential rains forced a halt on Monday (May 19) to Indonesia's search for 14 missing in its easternmost region of Papua after a landslide killed six workers at a gold mine and injured four, officials said.

The rains had triggered Friday's landslide, which hit a small mine run by residents of the Arfak mountains of West Papua province, said Abdul Muhari, the spokesperson of Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency.

Authorities will resume on Tuesday their search for those missing after the disaster, which engulfed temporary shelters used by miners.

The search effort was hampered by ""damaged roads and mountainous tracks as well as bad weather"", Yefri Sabaruddin, the head of a team of 40 rescuers, including police and military officials, who retrieved five bodies, told Reuters.



Travelling to the site required 12 hours from the nearest town, he said.

Monday's tally was updated from an earlier figure of one dead and 19 missing.

Small-scale and illegal mining has often led to accidents in Indonesia, where mineral resources are located in remote areas, in conditions difficult for authorities to regulate.

The number of casualties could rise.

At least 15 people died in the collapse of an illegal gold mine in West Sumatra province last September after a landslide caused by heavy rains.

CNA,Philippines' Marcos says he is open to reconciling with Dutertes,"MANILA: Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr said he was open to reconciling with the Duterte family, one week after allies of his estranged Vice President, Sara Duterte, outperformed expectations in a fiercely contested and pivotal Senate race.

In a podcast shared on his Facebook page on Monday (May 19), Marcos said he needed friends rather than enemies as he seeks to use the remaining three years of his term to deliver on his agenda.

Philippine presidents are limited to a single six-year term.

""Yes,"" Marcos said when asked if he would be open to mending fences, after a bitter and very public falling-out between Marcos and the Duterte camps, which has fractured the once-powerful alliance that swept both to victory in 2022.



""As much as possible, what I am after is stability ... so that we can do our jobs. That is why I am always open to things like that,"" he told the podcast.

Duterte's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Marcos' remarks.

Sara Duterte is facing a Senate impeachment trial that could see her removed from office and permanently barred from holding public office again, denying her a presidential run in 2028.

Her father, former President Rodrigo Duterte, was elected mayor of Davao last week, even as he is detained at the International Criminal Court on charges of murder as a crime against humanity.

Despite surveys predicting a Senate sweep by the president's allies in the May 12 midterm polls, some victories by Duterte-aligned candidates have given Sara Duterte an important foothold in the Senate that could prove pivotal in an impeachment trial.

All 24 Senators will serve as jurors in the trial, with two-thirds required to vote for the impeachment for it to succeed.

Marcos has distanced himself from the impeachment process, and on Monday said it was in the hands of the Senate.

""There's a process for that, let's allow the process to take its course,"" he said.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/philippines-marcos-open-reconcile-dutertes-5139401,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z
CNA,Four killed in Vietnam landslide after flash floods,"HANOI: A landslide following flash floods in a mountainous area of northern Vietnam has killed four people, the government said on Monday (May 19), as forecasters warned of further downpours.

The landslide occurred early on Sunday in Ba Be district of Bac Kan province following torrential rain on Saturday.

""A very big (noise, like an) explosion was heard from the top of the mountain. Then, soil, rock and water poured down from the mountain,"" a statement on the government's website quoted local official Tieu Xuan Tai as saying.

Tai said local residents had been aware of a 2m-wide crack on the top of the mountain that appeared several years ago.



Provincial authorities have issued warnings to the public and called for immediate safety checks for communities along streams, rivers and other areas vulnerable to landslides.

Residents must be immediately evacuated if they are at risk, authorities said.

Forecasters said rain in the area had been higher than normal so far this month, and further heavy downpours were expected in northern and central areas.

Vietnam is prone to tropical storms, which often cause deadly flash floods and landslides, but they usually hit the country between June and November.

Experts say human-driven climate change is causing more intense weather patterns that can make destructive floods more likely.

Last year, 514 people died in Vietnam due to natural disasters, three times more than in 2023, the agriculture ministry said.

In September, northern Vietnam was devastated by Typhoon Yagi, which claimed 345 lives and caused an estimated economic loss of US$3.3 billion.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/vietnam-landslide-flash-floods-four-killed-rain-5139036,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z
CNA,Bomb blast kills four in southwest Pakistan: Officials,"QUETTA: At least four people were killed while 12 others were wounded in a bomb blast in Pakistan's turbulent southern province of Balochistan, a security official said on Monday (Apr 19).

An improvised explosive device (IED) was planted in a parked car in Killa Abdullah district of Balochistan, less than 100km from the provincial capital Quetta.

""It seems the IED exploded before reaching its intended destination,"" a local security official, Ghulab Khan, told AFP.

""All those killed are civilian passersby,"" he added.



Riaz Khan Dawar, a senior local government official, confirmed the details to AFP, adding the explosion took place close to a paramilitary compound on Sunday evening.

Pakistan has been battling a separatist insurgency in Balochistan for decades, where militants target state forces, foreign nationals, and non-locals in the mineral-rich southwestern province bordering Afghanistan and Iran.

The attack came days after four paramilitary officials were killed in the province.

The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) is the most active group in the region and often carries out deadly attacks against security forces, but the local chapter of the Islamic State group has also claimed recent attacks.

Pakistan has witnessed a sharp rise in violence in its regions bordering Afghanistan since the Taliban returned to power in Kabul in 2021, with Islamabad accusing its western neighbour of allowing its soil to be used for attacks against Pakistan – a claim the Taliban denies.

In Balochistan, separatist violence has intensified, including a March attack by ethnic Baloch militants on a train carrying 450 passengers, which sparked a two-day siege and left dozens dead.

More than 241 people, mostly security officials, have been killed in attacks since the start of the year by armed groups fighting the government in both Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, according to an AFP tally.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/bomb-blast-kill-four-southwest-pakistan-balochistan-5139321,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z
CNA,Photo group says it has 'suspended attribution' of historic Vietnam picture because of doubts,"An organisation that honoured The Associated Press' Nick Ut with its “photo of the year” in 1973 for a picture of a girl running from a napalm attack in the Vietnam War says it has “suspended its attribution” to Ut because of doubts over who actually took it.

World Press Photo's report on Friday (May 16) adds to the muddle over an issue that has split the photographic community since a movie earlier this year, The Stringer, questioned Ut's authorship. The photo of a naked and terrified Kim Phuc became an iconic symbol of the war's tragedy.

After two investigations, The Associated Press said it found no definitive evidence to warrant stripping Ut's photo credit. The AP said it was possible Ut took the picture, but the passage of time made it impossible to fully prove, and could find no evidence to prove anyone else did.

World Press Photo said its probe found that two other photographers - Nguyen Thanh Nghe, the man mentioned in The Stringer and Huynh Cong Phuc -“may have been better positioned” to take the shot.



“We conclude that the level of doubt is too significant to maintain the existing attribution,” said Joumana El Zein Khoury, executive director of World Press Photo. “At the same time, lacking conclusive evidence pointing definitively to another photographer, we cannot reassign authorship, either.”

World Press Photo, an organisation whose awards are considered influential in photography, won't attempt to recover the cash award given to Ut, a spokeswoman said.

Ut's lawyer, James Hornstein, said his client hadn't spoken to World Press Photo after some initial contact before The Stringer was released. “It seems they had already made up their mind to punish Nick Ut from the start,” he said.

Gary Knight, a producer of The Stringer, is a four-time judge of the World Press Photo awards and was once a consultant to the World Press Photo Foundation.

The AP said Friday that its standards “require proof and certainty to remove a credit and we have found that it is impossible to prove exactly what happened that day on the road or in the (AP) bureau over 50 years ago”.

“We understand World Press Photo has taken different action based on the same available information, and that is their prerogative,” the statement said. “There is no question over AP's ownership of the photo.”

Meanwhile, the Pulitzer Prize that Ut won for the photo appears safe. The Pulitzers depend on news agencies that enter the awards to determine authorship, and administrator Marjorie Miller - a former AP senior editor - pointed to the AP’s study showing insufficient proof to withdraw credit. “The board does not anticipate future action at this time,” she said on Friday.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/napalm-girl-vietnam-war-photo-attribution-suspended-because-doubts-5135906,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z
CNA,China's humanoid robots will not replace human workers: Official,"BEIJING: China's humanoid robots will not replace human workers and cause mass unemployment, according to a Chinese official who oversees a tech hub in Beijing, amid a rapid expansion of the sector and state funding for it.

Liang Liang, a deputy director at the Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area, which hosts one of China's largest tech hubs, said in an interview on Friday (May 16) with foreign media that he does not believe that humanoid robots will replace their human creators, but will boost productivity and operate in hazardous environments.

""We don't believe robots will make people unemployed, but rather they'll boost efficiency or take on tasks humans are unwilling to do - like exploring the vast universe or the ocean depths where people can't go. Machines can assist us in that exploration,"" Liang said.

""When it's nighttime and humans need rest, machines could keep working, giving us better, cheaper and more user-friendly products. So we see this as the direction for our future development,"" he added.

Liang explained that the world's first robot half-marathon held last month in Beijing was deliberately set up in a way that would highlight his and other officials' hopes that these humanoids will support and assist humans, rather than replace them.

The half-marathon featured two tracks separated by a railing, with humans competing against each other on one side while on the other side 20 teams each operated a robot, varying wildly in size and ability.

""You see, in the marathon, humans have their track where they push their physical limits, and the machines have their own track where they jointly challenge their limits - but they aren't trying to take over the human course to sprint to the finish line. The future will be like this too,"" Liang said.

Liang spoke to reporters at the headquarters of state-backed X-Humanoid, also known as the Beijing Humanoid Robotics Innovation Centre, whose robot Tiangong Ultra won the inaugural robot half-marathon.

Besides the sports-focused Ultra model, which can reach a top speed of 12kmh, the centre also displayed other protypes that showed it was working on robots that can complete mundane tasks in the face of obstructions and changing environments.

In one demonstration, an employee repeatedly moved the position of a piece of litter or snatched it from the robot's hand, which would then relocate the object and carry out the task until it was completed, a self-corrective ability the centre says will be key in turning the humanoids into productive workers.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/east-asia/china-humanoid-robots-job-replacement-unemployment-beijing-5136286,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z
CNA,Indian Premier League returns to action with Punjab edging Rajasthan,"JAIPUR: Afghanistan's Azmatullah Omarzai marked the restart of the Indian Premier League with a fine all-round contribution as Punjab Kings closed in on a play-off spot with a 10-run win over Rajasthan Royals on Sunday.

It was the first completed match since the resumption of the T20 tournament which had been paused because of the latest India-Pakistan conflict.

Saturday's scheduled return ended in a washout with the game between Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Kolkata Knight Riders abandoned without a ball being bowled.

The weather was more clement in Jaipur as Punjab posted 219-5 when they elected to bat first in high-scoring match.



Left-handed Nehal Wadhera top-scored with 70 off 37 balls before Shashank Singh made the team finish strong with his unbeaten 59.

Omarzai boosted the total with his unbeaten nine-ball 21 before he returned with two key wickets to restrict Rajasthan to 209-7.

Punjab are second in the 10-team table topped by Royal Challengers Bengaluru. Both teams are on 17 points in 12 matches.

Impact substitute Harpreet Brar stood out with figures of 3-22 with his left-arm spin and South African left-arm quick Marco Jansen took two wickets in the final over when Rajasthan needed 22 for a win.

Explosive opening knocks by Yashasvi Jaiswal and 14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi went in vain after the two left-handers fired Rajasthan to 89-1 in the first six overs.

Jaiswal hit a 25-ball 50 and Suryavanshi made 40 off 15 balls.

Suryavanshi, who hit an IPL century in 35 balls last month to shatter records, hammered the opposition bowlers for four fours and four sixes.

Punjab introduced spin in the fifth over and Brar dismissed both openers in quick succession, Suryavanshi chipping a leading edge to mid-off and Jaiswal, just after he had passed 50, failing to clear Mitch Owen at long-off.

The chase took another hit when skipper Sanju Samson fell for 20 off pace bowler Omarzai, who later removed the dangerous Shimron Hetmyer for 11.

Dhruv Jurel made a valiant 53 off 31 deliveries but fell to Jansen in the final over as he failed to meet the increasing asking rate.

Earlier Punjab's top three fell cheaply as Australian batsman Owen's IPL debut ended with a two-ball duck and Punjab slumped to 34-3.

The mercury in the afternoon soared above 42 degrees Celsius (107.6 degrees Fahrenheit) when Wadhera steadied the innings and hit back with his attacking play as he put on 67 with skipper Shreyas Iyer, who made 30.

Iyer fell but Wadhera kept up the charge with Shashank, who hit five fours and three sixes in his 30-ball knock.

Wadhera departed in the 16th over but Shashank and Omarzai added 60 off 24 balls.

Since the pause in the IPL, the tournament has been rescheduled with the final now set to take place on June 3.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/indian-premier-league-returns-action-punjab-edging-rajasthan-5138151,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z
CNA,Netanyahu says Israel will control Gaza as aid trucks prepare to enter,"JERUSALEM/CAIRO: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday (May 19) Israel would control the whole of Gaza despite mounting international pressure that forced it to lift a blockade on aid supplies which has left the enclave on the brink of famine.

The Israeli military, which announced the start of a new operation on Friday, warned residents of the southern city of Khan Younis on Monday to evacuate to the coast immediately as it prepared ""an unprecedented attack"".

""There is huge fighting going on, intense and huge, we are going to control all parts of Gaza,"" Netanyahu said in a video message in which he pledged to achieve ""complete victory"" with both the release of the 58 hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza and the destruction of the Palestinian militant group.

Even as the military warned of the attack, Reuters reporters saw aid trucks heading towards northern Gaza after Netanyahu was forced to agree to allow a limited amount of aid into Gaza in response to global concern at the reports of famine.

Netanyahu said US senators he has known for years as supporters of Israel, ""our best friends in the world"", were telling him the scenes of hunger were draining vital support and bringing Israel close to a ""red line, to a point where we might lose control"".

""It is for that reason, in order to achieve victory, we have to somehow solve the problem,"" he said, in a message apparently addressed to far-right hardliners in his government who have insisted aid be denied to Gaza to stop it reaching Hamas.

Overnight, Israeli air strikes killed at least 20 Palestinians, according to local medics, as the military said it hit 160 targets across Gaza over the past 24 hours, including anti-tank positions, underground infrastructure and a weapons storage point.

The Israeli military said forces engaged in a new campaign dubbed ""Operation Gideon's Chariots"" were active across Gaza, seeking to eliminate Hamas' military and governing capabilities and bring back remaining hostages seized in October 2023.

Netanyahu's office announced the easing of the aid blockade, saying Israel would let in limited amounts of food into Gaza.

Palestinian media said 50 trucks carrying flour, cooking oil and legumes would be allowed into the small coastal territory later on Monday, while Israeli media said nine trucks with baby food were expected to enter in coming hours.

Israel has faced rising international pressure over the blockade on humanitarian deliveries it imposed in March, shortly before breaking a two-month-old ceasefire, as aid agencies warn of famine in the enclave of 2.3 million people.

Nahed Shheibar, owner of a transport company involved in aid distribution, urged Gazans not to intercept or loot the trucks.

Separately, residents and medics said an Israeli undercover force killed a militant leader in a raid in the south as the army proceeded with its new ground offensive against Hamas-led Palestinian militants in the enclave.

Ahmed Sarhan, a commander of the Popular Resistance Committees, a militant group allied with Hamas, was killed in the raid by forces that entered the heart of the city of Khan Younis disguised as displaced persons, according to the medics.

Residents said Sarhan fought the force before he was killed, and that the Israelis detained his wife and children before retreating in a bus towards the eastern border with Gaza under a cover of fire from planes.

""As you see, they entered, opened a hole in the wall, entered the house and executed the father and took an 11-year-old child and his mother, and left,” said an eyewitness, Mohammed Sarhan, referring to the PRC commander.

Palestinian health officials said more than 500 people have been killed in attacks in the past eight days as Israel has stepped up its military campaign.

Israel made its announcement on aid after sources on both sides reported no progress in a new round of indirect talks between Israel and Hamas in Qatar.

Former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, who left the government last year after falling out with Netanyahu, said the fact Hamas remained in Gaza represented a ""resounding failure"" for the Israeli campaign and reflected the government's failure to plan for the future of the enclave.

If a plan to replace Hamas had been made, ""there would have been no debate about whether the aid would fall into the hands of Hamas, because it would no longer control Gaza"", Gallant said in a statement.

Netanyahu said ceasefire discussions touched on a truce and hostage deal as well as a proposal to end the war in return for the exile of Hamas militants and the demilitarisation of Gaza - terms previously rejected by Hamas.

Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri blamed Israel for the lack of progress at the Doha talks and said escalating its offensive would be ""a death sentence"" for remaining hostages.

Israel's ground and air war has devastated Gaza, displacing nearly all its residents and killing more than 53,000 people, many of them civilians, according to Gaza health authorities.

The war erupted after Hamas-led militants attacked Israeli communities near Gaza's border on Oct 7, 2023, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seizing 251 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/israel-pm-netanyahu-says-will-control-gaza-complete-victory-hamas-5139396,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z
CNA,Paris airport chaos to enter second day after air traffic breakdown,"ORLY, France: An air traffic control breakdown at Paris-Orly airport caused the cancellation and delay of hundreds of flights and the aviation authority said the chaos would extend into Monday (May 19).

The breakdown hit on Sunday and has affected thousands of passengers with some already sat in planes at the French capital's second biggest airport when flights were cancelled.

The control tower breakdown forced the cancellation of about 130 flights in and out of Orly Sunday, officials said.

It had not been resolved by late Sunday and the DGAC French civil aviation authority said it was ""asking airlines to reduce their flight schedules by 15 percent"" on Monday and warned that ""delays are expected"".

""The situation is improving but still requires traffic regulation,"" the DGAC said.

The authority blamed an air traffic control ""malfunction"". An airport source said there had been a ""radar failure"".

Flights to European and North Africa destinations and across France were among those hit. Long queues formed at terminals amid a frenzied rush to find alternative transport.

""We were in the aircraft, all seated and strapped in, ready to go, when they made us disembark and collect our bags ... then began the ordeal,"" said Azgal Abichou, a 63-year-old business owner.

""The only option is a 300 euro flight – and there's only one seat left, but there are two of us and we are not even sure it will take off,"" said Romane Penault, a 22-year-old student. ""So for now, we're going home.""

Agnes Zilouri, 46, tried desperately to find a seat for her 86-year-old mother and six-year-old son in the terminal. The family should have taken a flight to Oujda in Morocco on Sunday evening to go to a funeral.

""The flight is cancelled. Fortunately I am with my mother,"" she said.

Last year Orly handled about 33 million passengers, approximately half the number of the main Paris Charles de Gaulle international airport.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/paris-orly-airport-air-traffic-control-breakdown-5138756,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z
CNA,UK strikes EU trade and defence reset in 'new era' for relations,"LONDON/BRUSSELS: Britain agreed to the most significant reset of defence and trade ties with the European Union since Brexit on Monday (May 19) after United States President Donald Trump's upending of the global order pushed the two sides to move on from their acrimonious divorce.

Nearly nine years after it voted to leave the bloc, Britain, the second largest defence spender in Europe, will take part in joint procurement projects. The sides also agreed to make it easier for UK food and visitors to reach the EU, and signed a contentious new fishing deal.

Trump's tariffs, alongside warnings that Europe should do more to protect itself, forced governments around the world to rethink trade, defence and security ties, bringing British Prime Minister Keir Starmer closer to France's Emmanuel Macron and other European leaders.

Starmer, who backed remaining in the EU in the Brexit referendum, also bet that offering benefits to Britons such as the use of faster e-gates at EU airports will drown out the cries of ""betrayal"" from Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage.

Flanked by EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Antonio Costa, Starmer said the deal marked ""a new era in our relationship"".

Von der Leyen said it sent a message to the world: ""At a time of global instability, and when our continent faces the greatest threat it has for generations, we in Europe stick together"".

Britain said the reset with its biggest trading partner would reduce red tape for food and agricultural producers, making food cheaper, improve energy security and add nearly £$9 billion (US$12.1 billion) to the economy by 2040.

It is the third deal Britain has struck this month, after agreements with India and the US, and while it is unlikely to lead to an immediate economic boost, it could lift business confidence, drawing much-needed investment.

At the heart of the reset is a defence and security pact that will let Britain be part of any joint procurement and pave the way for British companies including BAE, Rolls-Royce and Babcock to take part in a €$150 billion (US$167 billion) programme to rearm Europe.

On fishing, British and EU vessels will have access to each other's waters for 12 years - removing one of the UK's strongest hands in any future talks - in return for a permanent reduction in paperwork and border checks that had prevented small food producers from exporting to Europe.

In return, Britain has agreed to the outline of a limited youth mobility scheme, with the details to be hammered out in future, and it is discussing participation in the Erasmus+ student exchange programme.

The agreement was denounced by Farage and the opposition Conservative Party, which was in power when Britain left the bloc and spent years negotiating the original divorce deal.

Britain's vote to leave the EU in a historic referendum in 2016 revealed a country that was badly divided over everything from migration and sovereignty of power to culture and trade.

It helped trigger one of the most tumultuous periods in British political history, with five prime ministers in office before Starmer arrived last July, and poisoned relations with Brussels.

Polls show a majority of Britons now regret the vote although they do not want to rejoin. Farage, who campaigned for Brexit for decades, leads opinion polls in Britain, giving Starmer limited room for manoeuvre.

But collaboration between Britain and European powers over Ukraine and Trump has rebuilt trust between the two sides after relations were badly damaged by years of arguments.

Rather than seek a full return to a pillar of the EU such as the single market, Starmer sought to negotiate better market access in some areas - a move that is often rejected by the EU as ""cherry picking"" of EU benefits without the obligations of membership.

Removing red tape on food trade required Britain to accept EU oversight on standards, but Starmer will argue that it is worth it to grow the economy and cut food prices. Trade experts said breaking the taboo of EU oversight for something that would benefit small companies and farmers was good politics.

Despite the agreement, Britain's economy will remain significantly different from before it left the bloc. Brexit cost London's financial centre thousands of jobs, has weighed on the sector's output and reduced its tax contributions, studies show.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/britain-eu-trade-defence-security-agreement-trump-ukraine-war-5138531,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z
CNA,"Spain blocks more than 65,000 Airbnb holiday rental listings","MADRID: Spain has ordered Airbnb to withdraw more than 65,000 listings for holiday rentals that violated existing rules from its platform as part of a general crackdown on a business blamed for contributing to the housing crisis in the country.

Most of the Airbnb listings to be blocked do not include their licence number, while others do not specify whether the owner was an individual or a corporation, the Consumer Ministry said in a statement on Monday (May 19).

Consumer Minister Pablo Bustinduy said his goal was to end the general ""lack of control"" and ""illegality"" in the holiday rental business.

""No more excuses. Enough with protecting those who make a business out of the right to housing in our country,"" he told reporters.

The Spanish government, as well as city councils and regional authorities, have launched a general crackdown on tourism rentals via sites such as Airbnb and Booking.com, which many Spaniards say are creating excess tourism, reducing the housing supply and making renting unaffordable for many locals.

Housing has become a major issue in Spain as construction has failed to keep pace with demand since a construction bubble burst more than 15 years ago.

According to official data, there were about 321,000 homes with holiday rental licences in Spain as of November last year, 15 per cent more than in 2020. Many more operate without official licences.

The Consumer Rights Ministry opened a probe into Airbnb in December.

A spokesperson for Airbnb did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.

In December, the company said it always asked hosts to confirm they have permission to rent their places and abide by all local rules. The company also said that the ministry had failed to provide lists of non-compliant accommodation, and that many owners do not need a licence to rent out their property.

The company said the ministry did not have the authority to make rulings over short-term rentals and was disregarding court rulings specifying that Airbnb was a digital, not a real estate company.

Bustinduy said that Monday's order had the backing of Madrid's high court. In January, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez unveiled a plan to raise taxes on income from holiday rentals through platforms.

Barcelona Mayor Jaume Collboni took Spain's toughest move so far in June last year when he ordered a total ban on tourism rentals by 2028.

Other European countries such as Croatia and Italy have also acted to slow down the holiday rental business.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/spain-blocks-more-65000-airbnb-holiday-rental-listings-5139106,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z
CNA,$TRUMP dinner blurs lines between profit and politics,"WASHINGTON: More than 200 guests on Thursday (May 22) will make their way to a ritzy country club just up the Potomac River from Washington, ready for a sumptuous dinner hosted by the president of the United States.

The lucky few are not top officials or visiting heads of state but the 220 biggest buyers of $TRUMP, a crypto memecoin launched by the US president in January.

The top 25 investors will enjoy even more special access: a private session with Trump before dinner, which is set at the Trump National Golf Club in Potomac Falls, Virginia, and a White House tour.

""The most EXCLUSIVE INVITATION in the World,"" a website dedicated to the event said. ""The question is ... ARE YOU IN?""

This dinner represents perhaps the boldest commercial venture of Trump's presidency, further blurring already hazy boundaries between politics and profit.

Launched hours before his January inauguration, the $TRUMP memecoin is only one example of the Trump family's ever-expanding moves into cryptocurrency.

Much of the crypto industry frowns upon these coins or tokens, fearing they tarnish the sector's credibility, amid reports of quick pump-and-dump schemes that leave unwitting buyers paying for assets that end up worthless.

$TRUMP saw a spike in value when it announced the dinner, but reports said that many of the winners of the offer, which closed on May 12, are now selling their memecoins.

Critics, including the typically Trump-friendly Wall Street Journal editorial board, point out that Trump and his allies, as the creators of the memecoin, have made US$320 million in trading fees, citing Chainalysis, a data analytics firm.

They also point out that the dinner allows foreign actors who otherwise cannot influence the White House to try to use the memecoin to buy favour with the government.

The crypto industry, which massively contributed to his campaign, has welcomed Trump's return to the White House, praising his promise for a clear departure from the scepticism of the previous Democratic administration toward digital currencies.

Those years were marked by major scandals, including the collapse of FTX, the crypto giant founded by CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, who is now serving a 25-year sentence for committing massive fraud.

But the controversy surrounding the dinner is complicating efforts to pass crucial legislation that would provide a clearer legal framework for stablecoins, digital assets that are considered safer and more established than more speculative corners of the sector.

""The American people deserve the unwavering assurance that access to the presidency is not being offered for sale to the highest bidder in exchange for the president's own financial gain,"" US Senators Adam Schiff and Elizabeth Warren wrote in a letter to the Office of Government Ethics.

Trump, despite previous hostility toward cryptocurrency, has already taken significant steps to reduce regulatory barriers, including an executive order establishing a ""Strategic Bitcoin Reserve"" that would maintain government holdings of the world's leading digital currency.

However, key Democrats in Congress are blocking other legislative advancements, frustrated by the dinner and other Trump family ventures into cryptocurrency.

These expanding connections include investment in Binance, whose founder is seeking a presidential pardon to re-enter the US market.

The investment is being made through World Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency venture backed by the Trumps that launched in September and has made major deals in the Middle East.

The company founders feature Trump's sons, Donald Jr and Eric, alongside Zach Witkoff, son of Trump's diplomatic adviser Steve Witkoff.

At an April crypto conference in Dubai, Eric Trump and Zach Witkoff announced that the state-backed Emirati fund MGX would use USD1, their firm's cryptocurrency, to invest US$2 billion in Binance.

Additionally, American Bitcoin, another venture backed by Trump's eldest sons, recently announced plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange.

That company will ride lower energy costs and environmental norms to lower the cost of bitcoin mining in the US.

""The US won the space race. We better win the crypto race,"" Eric Trump recently told CNBC.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/donald-trump-memecoin-dinner-cryptocurrency-us-5138841,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z
CNA,Former US president Joe Biden diagnosed with 'aggressive' prostate cancer,"Former US President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an ""aggressive form"" of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, his office said in a statement on Sunday (May 18).

Biden, 82, was diagnosed on Friday after experiencing urinary symptoms, and he and his family are reviewing treatment options with doctors, according to the statement.

""Cancer touches us all. Like so many of you, Jill and I have learned that we are strongest in the broken places. Thank you for lifting us up with love and support,"" Biden said in an X post early on Monday.

Cancers that have spread, or metastasised, are considered Stage 4, the most advanced. Most prostate cancers are detected at an earlier stage.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, of the 236,659 cases of prostate cancer diagnosed in 2021, 70 per cent were diagnosed before the cancer had spread beyond the prostate. About 8 per cent of new prostate cancer diagnoses that year involved advanced-stage disease.

""While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management,"" his office said.

Biden's physical health and mental acuity drew scrutiny during his 2021-2025 presidency. He abruptly ended his bid for reelection last July, weeks after a halting performance during a debate against Republican Donald Trump prompted panic among his fellow Democrats.

President Trump, who has repeatedly berated Biden since taking office in January, expressed sympathy on Sunday for Biden and his wife, Jill, in a post on his social media platform Truth Social.

""Melania and I are saddened to hear about Joe Biden's recent medical diagnosis,"" he wrote, referring to first lady Melania Trump. ""We extend our warmest and best wishes to Jill and the family, and we wish Joe a fast and successful recovery.""

Biden's office said the cancer scored a nine out of 10 on the Gleason score grading system, which is used to help determine the aggressiveness of prostate cancer.

Dr Herbert Lepor, a urologist at NYU Langone, said a score of nine is ""very high risk"", but added that many men can live ""five to 10 years and beyond"" even with metastatic prostate cancer.

""Over the last decade, there have been many advances in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer,"" he said.

Dr Chris George, the medical director of the cancer program for the Northwestern Health Network, said prostate cancer is no longer curable once it spreads to the bones but that there are treatments that can control it.

Biden was the oldest person to win the US presidency at the time of his election in 2020. Trump, 78, broke that record when he defeated Vice President Kamala Harris last year.

Some prominent Democrats have recently acknowledged that it was an error to advance Biden as the 2024 nominee, given widespread concerns among voters about his age. Long before the debate last summer, Reuters/Ipsos polls showed a majority of Americans, including most Democrats, believed Biden was too old to serve a second term.

""It was a mistake for Democrats to not listen to the voters earlier,"" Democratic US Senator Chris Murphy told NBC News' Meet the Press on Sunday morning, before Biden's diagnosis was announced.

Biden has kept a low profile since leaving office, making only a handful of public appearances, including an April speech in which he defended the Social Security Administration against Trump's planned cuts.

He has also defended his legacy in interviews and rejected reporting in two new books that he suffered from cognitive decline during his last year in office.

""They are wrong,"" he said earlier this month on ABC's The View, referring to the books' authors.

Biden's diagnosis triggered an outpouring of supportive statements on Sunday from Democrats and Republicans alike.

""Joe is a fighter - and I know he will face this challenge with the same strength, resilience and optimism that have always defined his life and leadership,"" Harris said in a statement.

Biden lost a son, Beau Biden, in 2015 due to brain cancer.

In 2022, Biden revived an Obama-era programme known as Cancer Moonshot, seeking to reduce the death rate from cancer by at least 50 per cent over the next 25 years.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/joe-biden-aggressive-prostate-cancer-5138301,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z

CNA,Commentary: Political dynasties are making a comeback in Southeast Asia. Here's why it matters,"RABAT, Morocco: In the Philippines’ midterm elections this week, the Marcoses and Dutertes were once again front and centre in headlines, showing the continued dominance of political families in the Southeast Asian nation.

Despite being detained in The Hague for crimes against humanity, former President Rodrigo Duterte was overwhelmingly elected as mayor of his home city in Davao. His youngest son clinched the vice-mayor position, while his eldest son was re-elected as a member of the House of Representatives and two of his grandsons secured key Davao city posts.

Meanwhile, his daughter Sara is the country’s vice president, although now facing impeachment proceedings over an alleged threat to assassinate ally-turned-foe President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr.

The bitter feud between the pair has polarised voters and raised concerns over political stability ahead of the 2028 presidential race.

It has also brought into renewed attention the staying power of political dynasties, not just in the Philippines, but across Southeast Asia.

Mr Marcos was sworn in as president of the Philippines in June 2022, marking a dramatic return to power for a family once ousted in a popular uprising.

His victory, built on a campaign that rewrote his father’s dictatorial legacy, underscored a paradoxical trend in Southeast Asia where political dynasties continue to thrive in democracies that ostensibly reject inherited power.

From Thailand’s Shinawatra clan to Indonesia’s Sukarno lineage, political families wield significant influence throughout the region, or at least try to do so. This raises urgent questions about representation, accountability and the future of democracy itself.

Southeast Asia’s affinity for hereditary politics is deeply rooted in its colonial and post-independence history. 
Modern state structures in the region emerged from administrations that relied on local elites to maintain control. These elites – wealthy landowners or traditional leaders – transitioned seamlessly into political roles after independence, blending kinship networks with bureaucratic power.

The result was a system where family ties, rather than meritocratic ideals, became the currency of influence. In the Philippines, the Marcos family’s resurgence reflects a nostalgia among some voters for an era of perceived stability, even as critics warn of historical amnesia.

The persistence of these dynasties hinges on three interconnected factors: name recognition, resource control and patronage networks.

Political heirs inherit more than just a surname; they wield established voter loyalty and infrastructure. Thailand’s Pheu Thai Party, long associated with the Shinawatra family, has repeatedly leveraged its rural support base, built through populist policies such as healthcare and farm subsidies. Such dynasties consolidate power by directing state resources to loyal constituencies, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of dependency.

While political heirs are often male – sons like Mr Marcos, Cambodia’s Hun Manet, or Najib Razak in Malaysia, groomed to succeed their fathers – the region also offers examples of women inheriting political legacies.

Thailand’s Paetongtarn Shinawatra, daughter of exiled former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, has emerged as a leading figure in her family’s party, framing her rise as a continuation of her father’s populist agenda. In Indonesia, Ms Megawati, daughter of founding president Sukarno, served as president from 2001 to 2004 and remains a key figure in Indonesian politics.

Yet, even as these women ascend, they confront entrenched gender biases, navigating a dual burden of upholding familial legacies while operating in systems still dominated by men.

The rise of hereditary democracy, as critics term it, poses a fundamental challenge to egalitarian ideals.

While dynasties project stability, their dominance risks entrenching inequality and stifling competition. Younger leaders from non-elite backgrounds struggle to access funding or media visibility, perpetuating a closed system.

According to the Philippines Center for Investigative Journalism, at least two dozen political dynasties were seeking to secure at least five seats each in the May 2025 elections. With such dominance, policymaking risks becoming a battleground for elite factions rather than a forum addressing broader public concerns.

This phenomenon is far from unique to Southeast Asia. Across the globe, hereditary politics thrives in both emerging and established democracies.

In the United States, names like the Kennedys, Bushes and Clintons have shaped national politics for decades, while Canada’s Trudeaus and France’s Le Pens underscore how familial legacies permeate Western democracies. In India, the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty has dominated Congress Party politics for generations.

Globally, the phenomenon has drawn scrutiny for perpetuating power imbalances. Hereditary politics undermines meritocracy, as governance becomes less about collective welfare and more about maintaining dynastic control.

In Southeast Asia, as in the West, voters oscillate between frustration with elite entrenchment and resignation to its inevitability. The key difference lies in institutional resilience, with stronger institutions in established democracies often mitigating some, if not most, of the corrosive effects of dynastic rule.

Breaking this cycle requires systemic reforms – strengthening party systems, enforcing anti-nepotism laws, and empowering grassroots movements. However, elites often adapt, co-opting reforms to maintain influence.

The rise of social media offers a glimmer of disruption, enabling outsider candidates to bypass traditional gatekeepers. Yet, dynasties are also learning to leverage these platforms, as Mr Marcos’s TikTok-driven rebranding demonstrated.

Meanwhile, the global discourse on “political nepo-babies” highlights growing disillusionment with hereditary privilege, pressuring democracies to reckon with systemic inequities.

Ultimately, Southeast Asia’s dynasties reflect a broader struggle to reconcile tradition with modernity. Their staying power lies not in inevitability, but in the unmet promises of their nations’ democracies.

As the region grapples with climate change, inequality and authoritarian resurgence, the question remains: Can it afford to keep power in the family?

CNA,"Commentary: Meet 'travel math', the sneaky cousin of 'girl math'","SINGAPORE: We’ve all heard of girl math. But the practice of young women justifying purchases with lighthearted unconventional logic is nowhere near as dangerous as its older, less conspicuous cousin: Travel math.

Recently, I took a blockbuster of a trip: London the first week, Amsterdam the next, and then New York for the last week, all to visit close friends and family.

Checking in at Changi Airport, I decided I wasn’t going to worry too much about money on this trip. I hadn’t had a proper break in some time, so I would focus on enjoying, not economising.

For the large part, I managed it. For just three weeks, I wasn’t a penny-pinching party pooper.

Upon returning to Singapore, I took one look at my credit card bill and my jaw actually, physically dropped. For the first time in my life, I came dangerously close to maxing out my credit limit.

I pulled up my banking app. Surely something had gone awry with a charge or two.

But as I scrolled, I saw only the truth reflected in my transaction history.

Flights weren’t cheap, even during the off season – just over S$2,200 (about US$1,700) to get me to the three destinations and home again. Not outrageous, but still a hefty chunk of change.

Any traveller worth their salt knows accommodations are the true budget killer of any trip. But I was fortunate enough to have loved ones in all three cities offer up spare beds and sofas.

“Look at all the money I’m saving on hotels and Airbnbs,” I thought. “Those flights practically pay for themselves.”

Travel math.

Some find their travel joy in luxury shopping, theme parks or extreme sports; my limited funds are all for the stage.

Shakespeare’s Richard II, led by Bridgerton’s Jonathan Bailey. Much Ado About Nothing, featuring Marvel stars Tom Hiddleston and Hayley Atwell. A revisit of Tony Award-winning Hadestown, to treat a childhood friend to my favourite musical.

Tickets for these went as high as £165 (US$219). The cheapest deal I scored: £25 (US$33) tickets to an underground parody of Dracula. “After all I’ve spent on other shows?” I thought. “I’ll see it twice!”

Travel math.

Much of the time spent reconnecting with friends and family involved food and drink, which isn’t cheap in these cities.

Once I hit New York, the card swiping only ramped up.

A raved-about revival of Sunset Boulevard. An inventive staging of The Picture Of Dorian Gray starring Succession’s Sarah Snook. Sunset Boulevard again, because it was just so good the first time.

None came close to eye-watering territory until these: US$377 to watch Hollywood heavyweights Denzel Washington and Jake Gyllenhaal go head-to-head in Shakespeare’s Othello, and US$427 to see Paul Mescal in a much-lauded revival of A Streetcar Named Desire.

If the West End cracked the dam, Broadway verily crumbled it.

It’s a dilemma familiar to many of us: how do we balance the need to treat ourselves while on break with the need to make sensible choices?

Unlike girl math, travel math knows neither gender nor age. Whatever your particular interests, travel itself is more expensive than it’s ever been, even for those willing to rough it. It’s not just airfares – accommodation costs, food and beverage prices, even tourist taxes are all at a peak.

Money flies when you’re having fun, but in a time where so many of us are overworked and overstressed, how do we put a price on respite?

Looking through my payments history, my first thought was: “My mum’s gonna kill me.” Never mind that I've been financially independent for almost 15 years.

Guilt gnawing at me, I consulted a close friend for advice. “Okay,” he said, “you’re guilty about spending S$500 to see Denzel. But what else could you have spent that S$500 on that would make you just as happy?”

In the cold light of hindsight, I considered each item on its own merit. Save for a couple of exceptions (sorry, Paul), each charge was… fine, for an irreplicable experience.

Sunset Boulevard’s limited run ends this July. Beyond this version of Dorian Gray, Sarah Snook isn’t likely to play 26 different characters in a single show again. And Denzel Washington is 70 years old – how many more opportunities will I have to see him tread the boards?

Given the choice, I’d do most of these again.

As a single, childless young adult still living under a parent’s roof, my monthly expenditure clocks in on the low end. I don’t go to expensive bars or restaurants. I don’t buy packages at spin or yoga studios, or trendy fitness gyms. I hate clothes shopping with a passion. On the whole, I keep a pretty tight hand on my purse strings most days.

As a colleague opined, what’s the difference between such holiday splurges and what others fork out to watch a FIFA World Cup game or a Taylor Swift concert live, or trek to Everest Base Camp?

Even so, it can’t be all give and no take. I spend time and energy earning and saving money, but what for? To look after my loved ones, to make sure I can weather potential storms – but also, surely, a little bit at least, to enjoy the sunny days too?

This isn’t to excuse or hand-wave away the decisions I made in those three weeks. Money is tricky that way – the collective impact of our choices often amounts to more than the sum of each individual choice.

Still, travel math, like girl math, doesn’t mean spending without reason. Next trip, I’m going to try budgeting differently: instead of the hazy umbrella of “travel costs”, I’ll set aside a sum specifically for my big passion (theatre) and use a card, account or e-wallet specifically for that. Not math for travel – math for me, personally.

Hopefully, this will help me avoid both spending precious downtime counting change and losing all the benefits of a good rest when the bill arrives.

Even more importantly, I hope not to wait too long to put this new theory to the test.

CNA,Commentary: China’s defence industry is getting a DeepSeek moment with India-Pakistan clash,"HONG KONG: In investing, narratives can matter a lot more than earnings or cash flow analysis.

Pakistan is certainly spinning a good story about China’s defence industry. Its army said it used Chinese J-10C planes to shoot down five Indian jets, including three Rafales, a MIG-29 and a Su-30. Rafales are made by France’s Dassault Aviation, while the other two were imported from Russia. India’s government has not confirmed or denied Islamabad’s claim and evidence remains inconclusive.

Nonetheless, investors got excited. It was the first real combat between modern Chinese warplanes and advanced Western jets – and surprisingly, China seems to have come out on top. On Monday (May 12), Avic Chengdu Aircraft, which made the J-10C jets, soared 20.6 per cent, while Dassault tumbled 6.2 per cent.

Some are hailing it as another DeepSeek moment for China. In late January, a little-known Hangzhou-based startup released an AI reasoning model that performed almost as well as OpenAI at a fraction of the cost, thereby propelling a bull run in Chinese tech names.

Are we witnessing a repeat, in defence this time?

I see parallels. While the jury is still out on how disruptive DeepSeek is to US big tech, its arrival has pointed to a new way forward for China, and shows that growth is still possible despite US President Donald Trump’s tariffs.

More than manufacturing electronics and apparel, Chinese companies can be good at making software, too, the thinking goes. Over time, they might just be able to gain market share in services exports, which the US dominates.

Similarly, Chinese defence companies might one day be able to sell more weapons overseas.

Between 2020 and 2024, China accounted for only 5.9 per cent of global arms exports, well behind America’s 43 per cent, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. In addition, there’s little geographical diversity; almost two-thirds of China’s weapons exports went to Pakistan.

So imagine China selling more warplanes and missiles to the Global South. Already, it’s the biggest supplier in West Africa, accounting for 26 per cent of total arms imports there. This is lucrative business: Dassault Aviation notched 17 per cent net income margin last year.

To be sure, investors will have to wait for months, if not years, to see if developing nations friendly with Beijing will place more military equipment orders. But positioning well ahead of positive earnings is nothing new.

German and French defence names are on fire this year, triggered by the White House’s isolationist foreign policies and NATO countries’ vows to ramp up spending. Whether the Europeans can get their act together is another matter.

But that has not stopped Dassault from rallying more than 50 per cent for the year despite Monday’s drop. Meanwhile, Germany's Rheinmetall and Hensoldt more than doubled in market value.

There is also the lack of availability. One reason European military stocks are doing so well is because there are only a handful of publicly listed names that asset managers can get exposure to. After all, for decades Europe relied on the US for national security, so the continent’s defence industry is fragmented and in need of an overhaul.

A similar picture emerged in China. Military modernisation is new and the country only weaned itself off imported Russian weapons in the mid-2010s.

For arms exporters, there’s no better advertisement success in a real confrontation. In a way, China’s long-held friendship with Pakistan is already paying off. Islamabad is doing a great job marketing Beijing’s military might.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/china-fighter-jet-military-india-pakistan-deepseek-5132076,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z
CNA,"Commentary: Trump blinked again on tariffs, but China isn’t in the clear","HONG KONG: A trade war yields no winners. This notion has become widely accepted, since United States President Donald Trump sparked an escalating trade conflict with China last month, effectively bringing trade between the two largest economies to a near standstill.

The irony was palpable this week when both the US and China claimed victories after announcing a temporary tariff truce on Monday (May 12). This agreement drastically reduces tariffs on each other's goods for 90 days to ease tensions.

Mr Trump, in his characteristically grandiose manner, declared a victory, touting ""a total reset"" with China and hinting, without specifics, that China had agreed to fully open its markets to American businesses. The White House release hailed it a “historic trade win”.

Chinese state media and social media influencers hailed the agreement as ""a great victory"" for China.

However, beneath the spin and hyperbole lies the reality that this so-called ""reset"" will be far from straightforward.

Finalising a comprehensive deal could take months of challenging negotiations, considering trade and tariff discussions are likely part of broader negotiations involving issues such as fentanyl, semiconductors, rare earth elements, TikTok, Panama Canal ports, and possibly Taiwan.

And this assumes there are no further reversals due to Mr Trump's unpredictable nature or if talks go badly.

Signs suggest that Mr Trump's victory claim is hollow and disingenuous. After swiftly raising tariffs to 145 per cent, he expected Beijing to capitulate first.

But he grossly underestimated Beijing's political strategy, as well as its readiness and resolve to endure short-term economic hardship. In a strategic twist, Beijing effectively adopted Mr Trump's own tactic of maximum pressure, coupled with strong rhetoric about ""fighting to the end”.

This hard-nosed approach has paid off, ultimately forcing Mr Trump to yield. And make no mistake, Mr Trump blinked first – even if the US appears to impose a larger tariff on Chinese imports than the other way around for now.

Yet, China's ""great victory"" carries more political and geopolitical implications than economic benefits.

From a Chinese perspective, being the first and only country to stand up to Mr Trump's bullying tactics and win positions China as an undisputed equal to the US in the great power game – a status Chinese President Xi Jinping once described as ""viewing the world as equals"". This victory could bolster China's standing and improve its credentials as a leader of the Global South.

Economically, however, China faces mounting costs from the trade war, especially as its economy struggles with deflation and weak consumer confidence. That explains why Beijing is willing to sit down to talk with Washington. After all, a prolonged trade war could complicate or even derail China’s efforts to boost its economy.

More importantly, Beijing still follows the strategy formulated after Mr Trump’s first trade war against China in 2018: fighting but not breaking off.

Even after rollback, American tariffs on Chinese products remain substantial, particularly given that exporters' margins are typically between 10 per cent and 20 per cent.

The revised “Liberation Day” tariffs now stand at 30 per cent, down from 145 per cent. This comprises the 10 per cent baseline on all trading partners and 20 per cent fentanyl-related levy. Sector-specific tariffs like those on steel and cars remain.

If this rate persists, it could lead to a 36 per cent decline in China's exports to the US and a 5 per cent decrease in China's total exports, shaving 1 percentage point off this year's GDP growth, according to Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie Group in a research note this week.

But don’t forget there were pre-existing tariffs before Mr Trump started his second term. Taken together, the overall US tariff rate on Chinese goods is closer to 50 per cent.

Similarly, China's reciprocal tariff has fallen to 10 per cent from 125 per cent.  However, after factoring in the pre-existing tariffs, China's overall tariff rate on US products stands around 30 per cent.

For trade talks to advance, Mr Trump and Mr Xi will need to be actively involved in defining the parameters of a final deal. Mr Trump has suggested he may soon speak with Mr Xi by phone, which could lend credence to the best-case scenario of both sides working towards a comprehensive trade agreement.

Questions arise about how China is prepared to open up to American businesses, as Mr Trump claimed, and how the US is prepared to reciprocate.

From China's perspective, there are several steps it can take to reduce trade imbalances, a major source of tension between the two countries.

First, Beijing is ready to significantly increase purchases of American agricultural products and energy to reduce the trade deficit. Second, it can take measures to limit exports to the US, a trend already emerging as exporters diversify into other markets. Third, Beijing can continue to increase its holdings of US Treasury securities – China is the second-largest holder, with US$784 billion, after Japan. Fourth, Beijing can encourage more Chinese companies to invest in the US.

However, many questions remain. What concessions can the US offer China in return?

Can the US relax controls over high-tech products, including semiconductors? Even if Chinese companies wish to invest in the US, will they be welcomed at a time when even Chinese-produced garlic is deemed a national security threat?

Finding answers to these questions will not be easy.

CNA,Commentary: Sugary drinks are too ingrained in Singaporeans’ social lives,"BREDA, The Netherlands: There is a meme circulating on Instagram that describes Asian parents’ highest praise for desserts as “not too sweet”. Yet, an opposite trend is emerging among young Singaporeans, for whom sugary beverages such as bubble tea have become deeply ingrained in everyday life.

At the height of the bubble tea craze in the 2000s, it was not unusual for parents or older relatives to purchase the drinks in bulk as a gesture of care for the rest of the family. During my student days in Singapore, going for supper was also a common ritual. Ordering a sweet drink such as Milo dinosaur, teh tarik, barley water or bandung was the norm, whether or not you ordered food to go with it.

This cultural shift, however, comes at a significant cost to public health. According to the 2022 National Nutrition Survey, Singapore adults consume an average of 56g of sugar daily, with over half derived from sweetened beverages.

This excessive intake is more than alarming; it's a ticking time bomb for public health. Research indicates that consuming an additional 250ml of sweet drinks daily increases diabetes risk by up to 26 per cent.

A Nanyang Technological University study revealed that some young adults in Singapore consume as many as four sweetened beverages in a day and that many have low awareness of hidden sugars in these drinks, putting them at greater risk of diabetes and obesity.

Within the landscape of sweet beverages, it seems that bubble tea has a particularly strong grip among teenagers and young adults in Singapore. This is evidenced by some workplaces having informal bubble tea order systems, and the evolution of cafes like Chagee from grab-and-go spots to sit-down establishments that mirror traditional coffee shops.

Singapore's bubble tea market has an annual turnover of US$342 million, making it the fourth-largest market in Southeast Asia despite having the smallest population among the region's six key markets.

Bubble tea occupies a unique space between snack and drink. The Japanese term ""kuchisabishii"", which literally translates as ""lonely mouth"", alludes to the phenomenon of eating out of boredom rather than hunger. With bubble tea, you have both a beverage and a snack to chew on over an extended period, without the fuss of sitting down to a full meal.

In a country known for being a food paradise, young Singaporeans’ zeal for bubble tea can rival the ferocity with which locals debate the best places for chicken rice or nasi lemak. Virtual communities have spawned online, where aficionados passionately laud the merits of their favourite brands, dispense recommendations and discuss the ideal chew of bubble tea pearls.

Brands seem to be responding to this with creations that blur the line between beverage and dessert. Offerings include cane roasted genmaicha milk tea, chrysanthemum with honey pearl, peach oolong, and even bubble tea with a bruleed top.

These modern offerings make the flavours of “green apple ice blended”, “blue coral milk tea” and “pearl red bubble tea” that I’d grown up with seem utterly basic and ordinary.

While many consumers believe that choosing a lower sugar level, or omitting the syrup altogether, makes their drink healthy. This is often a misconception and could lead to an underestimation of the beverage’s sugar content.

According to the Health Promotion Board, even at zero per cent sugar, there are three teaspoons of sugar in a 500ml bubble tea drink with tapioca pearls – 30 per cent of the recommended daily sugar intake.

Recognising the severity of the situation, the Singapore government has implemented numerous measures to address this health concern. The Nutri-Grade system mandated front-of-pack nutrition labels for pre-packaged beverages in 2022, and was extended to freshly prepared beverages in 2023.

The 2023 ""siu dai by default"" movement also encourages food and beverage establishments to offer freshly prepared drinks with less sugar as a default, with about 60 per cent of outlets now doing so.

While this progress in reducing sugar intake is commendable, the question remains: Is there enough recognition of the unhealthy obsession with sugary drinks in Singapore?

For this, education is key. On a recent visit to Singapore, I was impressed by posters in train stations that offered bite-size tips on being a better listener to loved ones grappling with mental health struggles. If similar widespread campaigns that raise awareness about sugary drinks are implemented in places with high foot traffic, the results could move the needle.

There could also be stricter regulations on advertising, especially in schools, to prevent the normalisation of sweet drinks. I remember growing up in the 90s watching Milo advertisements on television that frequently featured athletes, and looking forward to the free Milo when the trucks came to our schools on sports day. Such associations shaped how healthy I believed malt drinks to be.

For many of us, sweetness, whether in the form of food or drinks, is often associated with comfort, celebration or stress relief. In fact, a cup of bubble tea can be one of the little joys of life.

The problem is when we drink more sugar than is good for us. It will take years for us as a society to get used to less sugar, but it requires a collective effort from policymakers, educators and individuals.

CNA,"Commentary: Vending machines for healthcare seem strange, but they’re a step in the right direction","SINGAPORE: One troublesome night, you’re unable to sleep due to severe stomach pain. You’ve already had some antacids, but they’re of no help. The nearest clinics and polyclinics are all closed, and you’re not sure if your condition deserves a visit to a hospital emergency room, where you may have to face long wait times. What do you do?

For many of us, the COVID-19 pandemic served as the catalyst for shifting away from the traditional model of primary care, typically involving an in-person visit to a general practitioner (GP) or polyclinic.

We quickly embraced telehealth apps, which could connect us to a doctor nearly 24/7 within a matter of minutes, obtain a diagnosis for select ailments, and even get medication delivered – all from the comfort of our homes. Telemedicine not only helped us observe safe distancing measures and avoid overcrowding in healthcare facilities, it also ensured that non-emergency conditions could be promptly treated by a suitable physician.

Five years on, while many of these benefits remain, even this level of technology remains inaccessible to some. For others, telemedicine has become little more than a convenient means of obtaining medical certificates (MCs), especially when getting out of bed to visit a GP feels impossible.

This issue has come under scrutiny, with several telehealth providers facing enforcement action from the Ministry of Health (MOH) following investigations into suspected unethical activities such as MCs and prescriptions being issued after inappropriately brief consultations.

Amid telehealth’s growing notoriety, a Dr Kart kiosk in a Tampines petrol station made waves online and in headlines last year. Public scepticism about an unmanned healthcare ""vending machine"" is understandable – but how sceptical should we be?

CNA reporters visited the Dr Kart kiosk in December 2024 to better understand how it worked. Based on their trial, one can justifiably expect that these kiosks offer a different user experience from that of telemedicine apps on our phones.

From a regulatory standpoint, however, they are basically the same.

MOH’s 2015 National Telemedicine Guidelines establish that telehealth services must meet a standard of care equivalent to that of traditional in-person consultations, within the inherent limitations of the virtual medium.

These guidelines apply to teleconsultations, whether through a kiosk or apps on personal devices. It doesn’t matter where the patient or the consulting healthcare professional is located, so long as they are not physically face-to-face.

Other legal and ethical frameworks, including the Singapore Medical Council's Ethical Code and Ethical Guidelines (ECEG), the Healthcare Services Act and the Personal Data Protection Act, are similarly applicable across all modes of telehealth delivery.

As for the specific question of MCs, MOH has reiterated multiple times last year the ECEG’s requirement that MCs be issued to patients based on proper medical grounds, only after a thorough clinical assessment. This is irrespective of the mode or location of consultation.

So, whether you see a doctor via your phone or a kiosk at the petrol station, you’ll likely receive an MC only after you’ve been properly assessed, just as you would be by a GP in a physical clinic.

The 2023 Healthcare Services (Outpatient Medical Service) Regulations (OMS) do introduce a degree of differentiation, largely in practical terms. For instance, Regulation 13 requires that remote service kiosks like the one in Tampines must meet specific standards for sanitation, maintenance, effectiveness and safety.

In truth, the Dr Kart kiosk is not the first of its kind.

In 2023, developer SmartRx launched a fully automated telemedicine “clinic"" at the Singapore University of Technology and Design in collaboration with healthcare group Minmed. Students and staff at the university could conveniently teleconsult with a doctor and check their vitals inside a private pod. Prescribed medication could also be obtained on the spot through an attached dispenser.

Later that year, a similar kiosk was set up at Jalan Besar Stadium as well.

Vending machines that can dispense competitively priced over-the-counter medication and other health supplies such as masks and first aid kits can now be found at various locations across the island, including the void decks of Housing and Development Board flats, condominiums and healthcare facilities.

Some are even able to dispense pharmacy-only medication after the patient completes a mandatory on-site teleconsultation with a registered pharmacist.

At its core, this emergent tier of healthcare services aims to enhance access to such care, particularly for those who may not be technologically adept.

Countries across the region including Malaysia, Thailand and India are similarly expanding their primary care infrastructure by deploying facilitated telehealth kiosks – especially in rural areas – to improve access to essential healthcare services.

These initiatives also have the potential to dramatically change both how healthcare is delivered as well as sought by the public.

Enabling the delegation of primary care services for non-emergency conditions can significantly reduce the burdens on acute hospitals and polyclinics.

In addition to shorter wait times and round-the-clock access, telemedicine also empowers patients to take charge of their own health by increasing the range of options from which they can seek timely care that best fits their needs. Incidentally, this is also in alignment with the goals of Healthier SG.

However, as self-service health technologies and telemedicine gain traction, their expansion must be accompanied by robust oversight to safeguard patient welfare.

For instance, the OMS mandates that providers should protect patients’ privacy and confidentiality during consultations. Teleconsultation kiosks raise concerns in this aspect, as onlookers in the vicinity can potentially observe consultations and access sensitive personal data.

A practical solution could be to incorporate private consultation pods as with other telemedicine clinics, so that patients can securely access care without compromising their personal data.

To ensure telehealth fulfils its promise, adherence to ethical and regulatory frameworks must take precedence over profit-driven motives. When implemented responsibly, these innovations can be transformative and must be encouraged.

The challenge is not just to embrace telehealth, but to shape it into a system that prioritises care over mere convenience, and integrity over expediency.

CNA,Commentary: China is prepared to freeze out US planemakers anytime,"SINGAPORE: It is astonishing how fast a brand can fall from grace.

Boeing was once the world’s largest planemaker, pipping its archrival Airbus with 806 commercial aircraft deliveries to 800 in 2018. In 2017, Boeing delivered 763 jets while Airbus delivered 718.

All that changed in March 2019. Two fatal crashes involving Boeing’s 737 MAX aircraft, killing 346 people in the space of five months, forced the aircraft type to be grounded between March 2019 and November 2020 by the US Federal Aviation Administration.

The MAX was grounded again in 2024, after a door plug of an Alaska Airlines’ new 737 MAX blew out midair in January of that year.

Fast forward to April this year, when US President Donald Trump introduced a slew of tariffs, with the most punishing ones reserved for China.

On Apr 15, Beijing instructed its airlines not to take deliveries of Boeing planes, including those already built, in response to the US decision to impose tariffs of up to 245 per cent on China.

China also ordered Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) to stop buying parts from US suppliers, an odd decision as COMAC sources over 40 per cent of parts from the US and Europe for its aircraft.

These developments were yet another blow for Boeing, which had previously projected brisk business in China. In August 2024, Boeing’s vice-president of commercial marketing Darren Hulst remarked, “China’s airlines will see strong demand, requiring further growth of their modern fuel-efficient fleets.”

Indeed, Boeing’s Commercial Market Outlook for China projected that the country will need 8,830 new planes by 2043 and its commercial fleet will grow 4.1 per cent annually over the next two decades.

While Western observers felt China’s drastic decision to suspend purchases from American planemakers would be a self-inflicted wound, the Chinese begged to differ.

People familiar with COMAC and the Civil Aviation Administration of China said the Chinese had anticipated Mr Trump’s moves when he won the elections last November.

“We knew tariffs were coming, there are plans B, C, D and so on,” an official told me. “We saw what happened to the Russians following sanctions (after the Ukraine invasion in 2022) and prepared accordingly.”

As a result of sanctions, Russian airlines and planemakers were unable to access replacement parts for its jets and were forced to ground aircraft.

While COMAC may not have publicly conceded to amassing foreign aircraft parts in the past two years, a source in Shanghai, where COMAC is based, suggested there is enough material to “make hundreds of aircraft in the next few years”.

COMAC is believed to have stockpiled at least 1,000 LEAP engines, specifically the LEAP-1C, which powers the C919, a single-aisle jet that competes directly with Airbus’ A320neo and Boeing’s 737 MAX.

The engine is co-produced by America’s GE and France’s Safran. The Airbus A320neo uses a similar engine, the LEAP-1A, while the B737 MAX is fitted with a LEAP-1B engine.

However, the engines used by the A320 and B737 MAX cannot be used by the C919; the LEAP-1C was designed exclusively for the COMAC jet.

An industry source told me that Chinese airlines have no qualms in suspending deliveries: “China must resist the US or it will take us for granted in future. While we do not blame Boeing (for the tariff war), this is no longer about trade. It is about sovereignty and dignity.”

The US and China agreed to reduce tariffs for 90 days on May 12, causing Boeing’s stock to rally to its highest price seen in over a year. On May 13, China reportedly reversed the ban on Boeing deliveries.

A source close to China’s regulator confirmed this, saying the decision was “in the best interest of both sides”.

While these are positive developments, the damage done by an uncertain tariff and regulatory environment may be lasting. It will also prompt COMAC to hasten its domestic aviation manufacturing goals to completely wean itself of Western dependence.

Prior to the US-China tariff pause, Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg indicated the trade war was a fluid situation and that the company was planning to remarket the 50 jets that China did not plan to take.

“We have many customers who want near-term deliveries,” Mr Ortberg said, possibly alluding to Asia Pacific airlines such as Malaysia Airlines and Air India, which expressed a desire to buy those jets.

Tensions created by Mr Trump’s tariffs pose real risks not just to Boeing but to COMAC.

For one, Boeing will need to temper its market outlook for China. Even if there is a rapprochement in future, the international aviation landscape would have changed permanently.

Boeing’s stock is benefitting from the latest detente but this is a blip. In the long run, the company must change its culture and, more importantly, its values.

COMAC, too, will not come out of this trade schism unscathed, although the Chinese believe they have the edge.

COMAC’s planes have not sold well internationally, partly due to lack of certification by US and European regulators and partly because there remains a stigma for China-built commercial jets.

The Chinese, however, are steadfast and will persevere. An airline analyst in Beijing remarked: ""We have a saying, 'loud thunder, small raindrops'. The Americans can shout all they want. This will hurt us less than them.""

In his book Dealing With China, former US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson wrote: “Facts, not wishes or dreams, should direct our dealings (with China). China is very different from the US and we cannot be guided only by the understandable desire that it become more like us.”

Perhaps Boeing’s CEO should make a call to Mr Paulson.

CNA,Commentary: The world’s most contagious disease is making an alarming comeback,"SINGAPORE: The most contagious disease known to humans is making a comeback.

The United States reported 1,001 confirmed measles cases and three deaths as of Friday (May 9), a dramatic increase from 285 cases and no deaths for the whole of 2024. Declared to have eliminated measles by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2000, the US risks losing that status by 2026, if this trend continues unchecked.

Measles cases have also been on the rise across Europe, with nearly 6,000 reported to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control this year.

Closer to home, 2,584 confirmed measles cases were reported in the WHO Western Pacific Region in the first three months of 2025, 50 per cent more compared to the same period in 2024. Of the seven Southeast Asian countries covered in this grouping, ongoing spread has been reported in Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam. Brunei and Singapore have eliminated measles in 2015 and 2018 respectively.

Measles is seen as the “canary in the coal mine” by public health professionals due to its extreme contagiousness. A single infected person can spread the virus to between 12 and 18 susceptible individuals – about twice as contagious as chickenpox and several times more than COVID-19 or influenza.

In the ongoing US outbreak, 30 per cent of cases are under 5 years of age, with one in four of this group requiring hospitalisation. Two children, aged six and eight, were among the confirmed deaths.

The WHO estimated that over 100,000 persons – mostly children under 5 – died worldwide from measles in 2023. In high-income countries such as the US and Singapore, the death rate from measles is about one in 1,000 cases.

Many of these deaths are preventable. A highly effective vaccine against measles has been commercially available since 1963 and the widespread use of different vaccine formulations has saved an estimated 94 million lives over the past half-century – more than all other vaccine-preventable diseases combined except smallpox.

A dangerous convergence of factors - largely unfortunate legacies of the COVID-19 pandemic – is fuelling the spread of the measles virus.

Simultaneously, vaccine hesitancy has also risen significantly. It has been systematically amplified by the proliferation of dis- and misinformation – particularly across social media – deepening distrust in public health institutions. Top US public health official Robert Kennedy Jr's tepid endorsement of measles vaccination coupled with occasional promotion of evidence-free treatment options such as cod liver oil have not helped, at least in the US.

Because the measles virus is so contagious, herd immunity generally requires population vaccination rates of at least 95 per cent. This makes it hard for the virus to spread, protecting those who cannot be vaccinated such as those with specific allergies and the severely immunocompromised (who cannot receive live vaccines).

Even a slight fall in vaccination coverage can create pockets of vulnerability. In the ongoing US outbreak, almost all of the cases were unvaccinated.

The presence of community cases of measles often signals faltering immunisation programmes, with other vaccine-preventable diseases to follow if nothing is done.

More frequent measles outbreaks often signal deeper issues in a country’s public health system and may be precursors to further public health emergencies. Conversely, the sustained elimination of measles generally indicates a well-functioning public health system.

This crisis is likely to worsen in the near future.

The US has long been a cornerstone of global immunisation efforts through bilateral and multilateral aid. The most significant of the latter is Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance which saw its billion-dollar grant cancelled by the Trump administration in March. This public-private partnership was established specifically to increase vaccine access in low- and middle-income countries and has helped vaccinate over 1 billion children worldwide.

Just as concerning is the uncertain future of the Global Measles and Rubella Laboratory Network coordinated by the WHO, which spans over 760 laboratories in more than 150 countries and is critical for global measles surveillance. With the US as its sole funder, the impending US withdrawal from the WHO will significantly cripple the network and surveillance efforts.

Can Singapore ignore this global surge? After all, close to 97 per cent of children here have received at least one dose of the MMR (mumps, measles and rubella) vaccine, theoretically preventing sustained spread of the virus. The Communicable Disease Agency has reported only eight cases of measles in Singapore since the start of 2025.

But we are not immune to the global measles situation.

Infants under one year of age are particularly vulnerable – they are too young to receive their first MMR dose under the current National Childhood Immunisation Schedule. Those who have received only a single dose of the vaccine and adults vaccinated decades ago may no longer enjoy full immunity.

The rise in global measles cases will mean more frequent importation of the virus into Singapore and higher risk of exposure for residents who travel overseas. Both scenarios may potentially lead to localised outbreaks, especially in settings such as infant care centres.

The pending void created by recent cuts in international aid cannot be easily filled, if at all.

However, countries with established expertise and capacity – including Singapore – could consider increasing contributions to regional vaccination efforts and outbreak response capabilities through bilateral partnerships or regional mechanisms such as ASEAN and the WHO Regional Office.

Such investments should neither be viewed as purely diplomatic gestures nor drains on national resources. They represent strategic and effective public health protection for the contributing countries themselves, reducing the risk of measles or other communicable diseases crossing borders.

It is important to recognise that measles vaccination is one of the “best buys” in public health intervention. For every dollar spent on measles vaccination, countries are estimated to receive up to US$58 in economic and social returns from reduced healthcare costs to increased productivity of those who would otherwise have been felled by the virus. Few public health interventions deliver such extraordinary returns.

Singapore must continue to ensure high vaccination rates and vigilance for more imported cases. This requires us to counter vaccine misinformation and address hesitancy.

We must robustly challenge misconceptions spread by anti-vaccine activism. Measles is not a mild childhood illness. The MMR vaccine is safe and is not associated with autism – the notorious study that made this claim has been debunked as fraudulent.

Measles is a test of a public health system’s strength. With the global surge in cases, the proverbial canary in the coal mine has sounded a clear warning against complacency, even for countries that have eliminated measles.

CNA,This art collector went from running his own marketing firm to opening galleries in Hong Kong and London,"Hong Kong native Calvin Hui always had a keen appreciation for visual arts, especially abstract art. What started as a hobby buying and collecting art that resonated with him, has turned into a lifelong passion. In 2011, he opened 3812 Gallery in Hong Kong, which specialises in Chinese contemporary art, particularly ink works. A few years later in 2018, he and his co-founder opened a gallery in London’s Mayfair, which will be relocating to The Whiteley London this Summer.

Hui reflected on his early days buying art: “The first art piece I bought was a print lithograph by Juan Miro when I was a student. I collected 20th-century modern art, with the small amounts of money I earned from part-time jobs as a student. It has always been my passion.”

When he set out to decorate his new home 20 years ago, Hui was on a quest to find and acquire more art. “In addition to the decorative pieces I've collected earlier, I consider the first ‘serious’ work I bought to be Jar with Horizontal Colour Bars (2005), by an Iranian artist Farhad Moshiri. It is a large piece, measuring 2 sq m. To be honest, I didn't do much research. It fit my budget and matched my home interiors perfectly. That marked the beginning of my journey as a serious collector.”

After his first acquisition, Hui continued to expand his knowledge about art by reading, going to exhibitions, and museums and subsequently attending fairs, thus growing his collection. As Hui’s collection grew, unexpectedly, he received a message from a gallery about one of the artists whose work he had purchased; the value of that artist’s pieces had skyrocketed at auction. This experience deepened his interest in learning more about art and collecting.

Before opening his gallery in 2011, Hui ran his own public relations, events, and marketing company. As his collection grew, he saw an opportunity to showcase the artists’ works in a gallery setting. Hui attributes his gallery success to his skillsets as a communications graduate. “It was a natural progression transitioning from a PR, events and marketing professional to an art business as a gallery owner, curator, dealer and collector,” he said. “My skills and experience have been incredibly beneficial to my art business; the storytelling, introducing artists and connecting with people came naturally to me.”

His foray into the auction market was an organic process that unfolded over several years. He became more involved in the art market beyond just collecting. He described the art scene in Hong Kong during his time as a collector, before opening his gallery in 2011: “It was all very organic. There were no art fairs, no Art Basel, and no established gallery districts in Hong Kong. I had the opportunity to meet with art institutions, get to know the community, and eventually began writing about art collections.”

Hui finds immense joy in art collecting, viewing it as a deeply personal journey enriched by the memories associated with each piece. “Every work I add to my collection — from travels or when enhancing my office or gallery — carries specific moments tied to the people I’m with and the places I’ve been,” he reflected. As Hui expanded his personal collection, he delved deeper into the art industry, educating himself about the market and discovering that art can serve as both an asset and an investment.

Yet, his passion and joy for collecting transcends monetary value. “Personally, when you purchase and collect art, when you live with art and appreciate its aesthetics daily, that's what truly holds value for me. If its price appreciates, that's just a bonus.”

A particularly cherished part of his collection features works by the late artist Hsiao Chin, who was not only a master of modern art but also a personal friend. “His ability to blend Chinese culture and Eastern spirit with modern abstract art resonates with me. Hsiao Chin created distinctive and meaningful pieces throughout his lifetime.”

Hui has two hats on when collecting, one for his passion and the other for the gallery. He is always on the lookout for emerging artists, to support them, providing a platform to showcase their talents. “I’m proud to feature several young artists in our portfolio. I assess their talent, commitment, and professional attitude, all while envisioning their long-term development. My goal is to guide these young talents as they navigate their artistic careers.”

The works of self-taught Hong Kong artist Thomas Ngan have piqued Hui’s interest. There are plenty of choices in the market and Hui does his due diligence. “Once I collect, I will commit to following the artist’s journey. Visiting exhibitions and art fairs is integral to discovering new talents. I can be quite impulsive, but I usually do my homework before purchasing. I keep my passion for collecting art for my personal collection and at the same time, I want to see how each artist develops their art and the unique artistic ideas and concepts they are trying to convey. Aesthetic quality, craftmanship and techniques are very important.”

Hui’s collection mainly features paintings — ink and Western, most of them focused on Chinese contemporary modern art, along with a selection of European works. Hui believes the rule of collecting is, “leading by the heart first and foremost. Whatever is visually captivating and speaks to you. You need to like it and connect to the artwork, it should bring you joy looking at it, rather than seeing it purely for investment. Art is unique. It’s not just a commodity. The best case scenario is that you appreciate it and see it as a long-term investment, instead of a short-term trade.”

Besides his ongoing quest to expand his personal collection, Hui is curating Light of Hope – Hsiao Chin 90th anniversary retrospective exhibition of the late artist Hsiao Chin at the Guangdong Museum of Art in Guangzhou that runs from now till Aug 17, 2025. This showcase celebrates the prolific works of Hsiao Chin, one of the pioneers of post-war abstract art, featuring pieces that date back to the 1950s. Simultaneously, he is preparing for the opening show at his new London gallery at The Whiteley, highlighting the Paris-based Chinese artist Ma Desheng. Having collected Ma’s work for 20 years, Hui has developed a close friendship with the artist and now represents him in both Hong Kong and London.

The behaviour of collecting can quickly become addictive regardless of the items one collects. “It's the thrill of treasure hunting, reading stories about the pieces – it’s all part of the pleasure of collecting,” he said. “When I find something I really like and have faith in the artist, I find myself diving deeper into the fulfilling journey of learning and acquiring their works.”",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/people/calvin-hui-art-collector-gallery-owner-london-hong-kong-5128976,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z
CNA,Nostalgia in Singapore: Why do we always long for the past and what does that say about us?,"When Isetan announced it would close its Tampines Mall outlet in November 2025 after almost three decades in operation, it wasn’t just a regular business winding up. It signalled to me the death of the Singaporean shopping mall template I have a love-hate relationship with, where a department store is the anchor tenant.

This wasn’t the only change in the past few years to the Singapore I grew up with. Each loss was made more pronounced against the post-pandemic landscape, where practically nothing was familiar anymore.

Several longtime or heritage businesses shuttered too, with a string of notable closures in expatriate enclave Holland Village, like the 80-year institution Thambi magazine store, party shop Khiam Teck and furniture business Lim’s Holland Village.

Then there was the slow death of cinemagoing, once a classic Singaporean pastime. Filmgarde Cineplexes exited the market in March after 18 years, while Cathay’s operator mm2 Asia in the same month continued its slew of closures, shutting down its sixth theatre in three years.

No matter the change, public reactions, perhaps predictably, centred around nostalgia. But this prevailing sentiment isn’t mere romanticism of the past.

I’ve found it masks deeper, unspoken anxieties about our shifting identity. Do we miss the physical entity that’s vanishing, or do we really miss the time and people we used to be that it represents?

Plus, what does it even mean to be Singaporean?

Some might say that it's our penchant for “chope-ing” (reserving) seats at hawker centres with tissue packets. Others might highlight our world class airport and Singlish – two hallmarks of Singaporean efficiency.

There’s also our multiculturalism, “kiasu” mentality (being afraid to lose), cookie-cutter shopping malls, grouchy taxi uncles, standardised Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats, and a peculiar belief that our food is better than Malaysia’s.

The way I see it, however, the crux of our national identity is less about these tangible anchors than our existential need for them.

This desire is most evident in nostalgia – increasingly common and inevitable in a country where change and progress are synonyms.

As a millennial digital native, I recognise that social media makes nostalgia more contagious too, creating an algorithm-aggravated collective pining for a past we never knew.

It’s captured in one popular Facebook group, for starters: Heritage SG Memories. Pictures of Wisma Atria’s iconic giant aquarium, for example, tend to see many members reminiscing about the days it was the standard meeting spot.

The aquarium, demolished in 2008, only featured occasionally as a gathering point in my memory – but I can’t be certain. Like plenty on social media, nostalgia also gets reduced to the most relatable anecdote, and I end up inheriting and remembering experiences I didn’t quite live through.

And this cultural yearning is only likely to increase, with rapid urban evolution the norm in a land scarce nation.

Hobbyist photographer Jonathan Tan noticed a similar sentiment when he started Lepak Downstairs – a photo series of old-school stools and tables found at HDB void decks.

Some people told him they appreciated his effort to “capture history in photos”, the 36-year-old said. Without such quaint designs anymore, newer Build-to-Order (BTO) flats “don’t have character”.

“I think people get emotional when these things disappear because there isn’t really a replacement. It feels like the disappearance isn’t justified. You’re taking a piece of their childhood … their memories away, but there’s nothing put in place for it,” he added.

So, it seems to many that being Singaporean – or at least having a sense of belonging to this country – lies in constantly navigating the gap between preservation and progress.

It’s a process often steeped in nostalgia.

The creator behind the Instagram account @hdb_mrt, whose film photos reflect a familiar overtone of longing, said he started the account almost a decade ago partly because he was “searching for this idea of home”.

Syafiq, who requested to only use his first name, said he didn’t just want to capture the older parts of Singapore that may soon disappear, but to “remember what we have now and to contemplate what it means to live in this country, to live as Singaporeans, to experience the world as we do”.

“Within that is also a sense of nostalgia,” the 36-year-old said. “Because the search for home is nostalgic in nature.”

To him, nostalgia is a “longing for a place, time, event or feeling that we cannot go back to”. It’s an emotion that “only exists when we have loss” and has to do with “how things have changed so much so quickly within our lifetime”, such as realising our childhood neighbourhoods are no longer the same.

Heritage educator and millennial Ho Yong Min has similarly observed that his generation is starting to wonder: “Are the places that I’m growing up in starting to be lost?”

The “trade-offs” create a “tension in our hearts”, believes the 41-year-old founder of The Urbanist Singapore, a content platform dedicated to heritage storytelling amid urban design.

“In Singapore where every square metre is optimised, it tightens the sense of how spaces are so precious. I think it becomes psychological angst for folks who are growing up and witnessing change, (knowing) that obviously has to be balanced out with the need for change. So it’s very complex.”

There is “a bit of a paradox” to negotiate living in Singapore, added Dr Felicity Chan from the Lee Kuan Yew Centre for Innovative Cities at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD).

“To enjoy Singapore, you must be very adaptable to change, but we also know that people like stability,” said the deputy director for the Master of Science in Urban Science, Policy and Planning.

Perhaps then, as Syafiq suggested, our nostalgia is also an “inability to be satisfied with what we have now” and a “reckoning of the present”. His photography, although it may resemble vignettes of a simpler Singapore, thus compels viewers to reflect on what it means to “be in the now”.

Some may argue the cure for nostalgia is not to get overly attached to anything – a neighbourhood shop, a local business, a daily path you take to work – in the first place.

SUTD's Dr Chan noted that it has become ""quintessential Singaporean to rationalise and not hold onto things too tightly"".

""We’ve learnt to accept that one cannot expect things to stay the same way for a long time … And because things change so quickly, you don’t even realise that you haven’t had enough time to develop the depth of emotions before (a place) is gone.”

Yet, forming attachment is only human nature. To deny ourselves that experience in exchange for an easier time letting go in future isn’t pragmatism, just cynicism.

And despite our best efforts, nostalgia resurfaces time and again. Even youth may start experiencing nostalgia at a much younger age too, being exposed to increasing online content about urban change in Singapore.

As a full-time educator, Syafiq said his students, most in their mid-teens, aren’t often “given credit” for the nostalgic feelings they have for their childhood. But he believes this nostalgia will inadvertently mould their Singaporean identity as they grow up.

Seeing nostalgia as integral to nation-building may hence better reveal what anchors our sense of belonging from an earlier age.

After all, as Dr Chan observed, the search for identity among youths is a lot more ""acute"" than in someone older, when there is more identity ""stability"".

With physical symbols of heritage, Ho from The Urbanist Singapore believes it’s important to take a “more nuanced view” to get people thinking about what heritage means to them. He focuses on how to respect and pay homage to our heritage rather than the “total loss” whenever a building or business disappears.

“Because heritage actually comes from the word ‘inheritance’. It’s something that we can steward from generation to generation,” he said.

“So while there is a feeling of loss, there’s also a recognition that there are government agencies like HDB and the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) that do what they can to try to infuse heritage and history into urban planning or a new estate that’s being developed.

“The question isn’t whether to develop, but how to integrate memory into progress. I feel that is the more constructive way forward – and obviously the ‘how’ to integrate is important. It should not be something cursory.”

Ultimately, things don’t have to last forever to leave a mark, even if that runs counter to the Singaporean instinct for stability.

While knowing this may not dull the weight of our perennial nostalgia, it just means nostalgia is as baked into our DNA as a desire for economic progress. For in a country where change is the only constant, loss is too.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/living/singaporean-identity-nostalgia-5082891,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z
CNA,"Quan Yifeng reveals why she fell out with ex-best friend Addy Lee, who also spills the tea on Michelle Chia","Mediacorp host Quan Yifeng has broken her silence on former BFF, celebrity hairstylist-turned-rabbit breeder Addy Lee’s accusations towards her.

On May 13 and 14, 2025, Addy Lee went live on Facebook accusing Quan and her daughter, China-based Singaporean actress Eleanor Lee, of being ungrateful.

He also claimed that Quan had a bad temper and after making S$300,000 doing livestream sales with him during the pandemic, she threw a tantrum and ended the partnership.

In an interview with Zaobao, Quan revealed the real reason behind their fallout, and why despite raking in the big bucks from livestreaming, she still chose to end the partnership.

Quan shared that at the start of the pandemic, Addy Lee saw a business opportunity doing livestream sales and roped her in.

As she had just sold her Siglap penthouse and home visits were banned during the lockdown, she moved into Addy Lee's home so they could continue their work together.

Thus began her gruelling routine, hosting programmes by day and livestreaming sales by night.

“I worked over 10 hours a day, and when I got home, I’d livestream all night. Once, I streamed for 14 hours straight. During those three months, I was exhausted to the point of wanting to die – but that wasn’t why I chose to leave,” she said.

Quan shared that when she was livestreaming, she made $400,000 over three months (not $300,000 in a month as Addy Lee claimed), which was more than what she earned in a year at Mediacorp.

“That money felt like it fell from the sky! It was the first time I saw such a large sum in my account,” she said.

But the “more [she] did it, the more afraid [she] became”.

Quan explained that her supervisors at Mediacorp had begun to notice her livestreaming activities and found it inappropriate given her employment there.

Furthermore, when Addy Lee began selling his self-developed products, she didn’t fully understand them and started to feel uneasy promoting them.

She also felt bad when she saw her fans buying products in bulk – more than they could use – just to support her.

“I knew if I kept doing it, I’d definitely get rich. But I didn’t want to exploit people,” she explained.

“These were the people who gave me a second chance, who helped me get back on my feet when I had fallen. I wouldn’t get a third chance. So I chose to step away.”

She recounted the night she made her decision: Hiding in her room, while Addy Lee’s assistant knocked repeatedly, asking her to join the livestream.

When she finally appeared, she had a “black face” and barely spoke, making the atmosphere awkward enough that Addy Lee ended the stream abruptly.

Soon after, she and Eleanor Lee moved out and left behind a long farewell letter.

“I reported everything to the tax authorities and also informed my company,” she emphasised.

Although word of their falling out spread quickly, when reporters approached her in 2020, she declined to explain.

“I believe in parting ways with friends peacefully. If we still have fate, let’s cherish it. If not, slowly fade from each other’s lives, that’s fine too,” she said.

Meanwhile, Addy Lee has turned the target of his tea-spilling spree to actress and former business partner Michelle Chia.

The pair, along with host Pornsak, had co-founded livestreaming company Mdada in 2020. All three have since fallen out with each other.

On May 15, 2025, Addy Lee shared that he would make revelations about Chia on his livestream and also questioned her about wages owed to him.

“Why haven’t you replied to my emails and text messages for a year? I just want your help getting my wages back, but you haven’t replied. Now I’m trying to retrieve my S$18,000 coffee machine and two Apple computers from the company – and still, no response,” he wrote.

Addy Lee also mentioned that when Chia had a dispute with Pornsak, he was the one who stood up for her.

He warned that if she didn’t respond before the livestream to clarify things, he would reveal her alleged “matters in Europe with a male celebrity”.

Chia later seemingly responded via her Instagram Story by sharing a philosophical quote about speaking wisely.

The video, titled “Speak with caution”, said: “Those who know do not speak; those who speak do not know. The wise speak slowly; the foolish speak too much. One is not valued for sharp words but for keen ears and sharp eyes.”

During his livestream that evening, Addy Lee alleged that during a live-selling trip to Europe, after their work ended, Chia and a male celebrity went out and did not return that night.

This reportedly angered Pornsak and he gave Chia a hard time afterward.

As for his own beef with Chia, Addy Lee said after they had a quarrel, she stopped responding to his messages.

He emphasised that his reason for going public was simply to retrieve “what he is owed”.

CNA,"Working through illness, not having time for vacations: How some hawkers cope with NEA's rule against absenteeism","For several months now, Mr Tan has been serving plates of fried hokkien mee to customers at a food centre in central Singapore as though he is a seasoned veteran.

However, discerning regulars who patronise the stall might notice a change in taste, because their noodles used to be prepared by a woman.

As it turns out, Mr Tan is not the stallholder. The stall belongs to the woman, who is in her 70s. She was ill and has not been mobile.

Mr Tan said in Mandarin that she does not have the strength to run the stall by herself for the time being. “I’m temporarily helping her, we’ll monitor what her health is like first.

“If she gets better, then she can probably return to work but just come a bit later in the day.”

Yet, Mr Tan is aware that by helping out his friend for such a lengthy period of time, it is technically breaching a rule in his friend’s tenancy agreement with the National Environment Agency (NEA) that requires stallholders to personally operate their stalls.

Aimed at preventing stallholders from subletting their stalls to others by mandating the physical presence of the registered owner, the regulation ultimately prevents rents and food prices from hiking and allows enterprising hawkers to enter the industry fairly.

NEA’s long-standing rule became the subject of controversy earlier this year after one owner of a nasi lemak stall took to Facebook to rail against it, after his pregnant wife – the registered owner – was warned for failing to be physically present at her stall in Yishun.

In this case, the stall owner adopted a franchise model, operating at least 26 stalls around Singapore, including in malls and privately run food centres.

Dr Koh Poh Koon, Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment, said in a Facebook post in March that NEA identified and warned more than 230 stalls last year because they were not personally manned by owners.

Of these, 30 were issued with notices to terminate their tenancies when they did not heed the warnings.

From these warnings and notices, more than 100 stalls terminated their tenancies, while the rest were able to continue operations because they had given valid reasons for their absence.

With around half of the hawkers who were warned by NEA ultimately let off the hook because they were found to have genuine reasons, CNA TODAY visited eight hawker centres to find out how stallholders – particularly those who do not operate franchise chains – are coping with this rule.

Most agreed that such a rule is effective in deterring subletters and preventing large franchise chains from dominating NEA-run hawker centres, but there were also older stallholders who said that the rule was forcing them out of the trade.

Anecdotally, many ageing stallholders still relied on hired assistants to run the majority of the business, sometimes for the whole day.

Their reasons include circumstances that are beyond their control, such as illness, fatigue, or suddenly having to pick up supplies.

For some, it meant having to explain their absences to NEA officers who carry out regular inspections.

A few hawkers said they would even work through sickness and poor health in order to not put their businesses at risk of closure.

Despite the leeway already granted by the authorities, two experts who spoke to CNA TODAY said that there was a need for greater flexibility.

They raised suggestions such as allowing stall assistants to ""hold the fort"" temporarily, as well as vacation days for hawkers.

Dr Lily Kong, president of Singapore Management University (SMU) who researches urban infrastructure and also co-wrote a paper on hawker culture, said: “The desire to prevent subletting is understandable. However, the manner in which it is effected requires rethinking.”

Hawker stalls are meant to provide Singaporeans with the opportunity to start and run a small food business, which is why stallholders are required to personally operate their stalls, the authorities have stated previously.

Explaining the rationale behind such a rule, Dr Koh Poh Koon, Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment, said in parliament that it exists to prevent subletting.

“If this requirement is not imposed, the tenant who has successfully bid for the stall could potentially sublet the stall and collect the difference in rent. It may encourage persons to bid for a stall without an intention to run a stall but only to sublet it,” he said.

Should the tenant be unable to operate the stall, the tenant is then expected to return the stall to NEA, allowing other new hawkers a fair chance to enter the trade.

Dr Koh was responding to a parliamentary question filed by Holland-Bukit Timah Group Representation Constituency MP Edward Chia after a Yishun stallholder questioned the anti-subletting rule earlier this year.

The hawker, Mr Noorman Mubarak, had complained in a Feb 18 Facebook post that he was forced to make his heavily pregnant wife tend their nasi lemak stall at Yishun Park Hawker Centre. The stall is registered under his wife’s name.

The stall, Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang, is part of the couple’s chain of more than 20 stores across Singapore, including in hawker centres managed by the National Environment Agency (NEA), malls and privately run eateries.

In a Facebook post following the parliamentary debate, Dr Koh said that many people have given feedback to him to support the government’s policy and called for NEA to take firm action against subletters.

“Requiring stallholders to physically operate their stalls remains the most practical and fair way of preventing subletting and ensuring that hawker stalls are not misused for rent-seeking motives,” he said.

Nevertheless, Dr Koh highlighted the challenges that NEA officers face when detecting subletting, stating that the approach “isn’t always straightforward”.

“Subletting is done under the table ... NEA has to conduct thorough investigations to uncover and substantiate such cases. This may include collecting documentary and photo evidence, conducting interviews with hawkers and relevant parties, as well as repeated checks over a period of time, before taking action against errant stallholders.”

In response to queries about how NEA exercises flexibility, the authority directed CNA TODAY to publicly available information on what hawkers can or cannot do.

Those who wish to expand their businesses can do so by holding up to two cooked food stalls in hawker centres, provided they are able to divide their time and operate the stalls personally.

Hawkers have also made use of other arrangements to grow their businesses, such as taking on more stalls at hawker centres with their family members as stallholders.

To this, NEA has said it “appreciates” the challenges that hawkers face in balancing their personal circumstances with business operations.

If hawkers are temporarily unable to operate their stalls – due to medical reasons, for example – the authority has exercised flexibility in these cases.

The stallholder may appoint a joint operator or a nominee to operate the stall during that period of absence. Both the stallholder and the joint operator are each required to personally operate the stall for at least four hours each business day, and their operation hours cannot overlap.

In the event that the stall has to shut for a period of time, NEA may offer rental waivers to the stallholder.

These rules only apply to tenancy agreements for stallholders in NEA-managed hawker centres.

Many hawkers who spoke to CNA TODAY said that the NEA rule was an effective deterrent to those thinking of subletting their stalls.

Mr Lew Yew Liang, 55, who owns Shan Zhong Bao Herbal Soup at Berseh Food Centre, said the anti-subletting rule has been in place for many years and he has had no issues abiding by it.

“The rule is fair. Our rent is already very cheap compared to coffee shops. By all means, people can rent at coffee shops,” he said.

However, to Mr Tan, the fried hokkien mee assistant helping his friend, the requirement to personally man the stall makes the trade unsustainable for older hawkers.

“Some people will not be able to carry on with the business at all,” he said.

He also said he was ready to explain to the authorities why his friend was unable to tend the stall if approached by officers.

“NEA has to understand that hawkers are old. Even though their heart is there, they don’t have the strength to stand there for eight hours.”

He did not state if she had considered appointing him as a joint operator, though the rules stipulate that even if she did, she would need to be physically present at the stall for four hours.

In any case, Mr Tan said she cannot bear to give up her stall completely, because it would mean the loss of her only source of income.

That was why she paid Mr Tan to work as her assistant and take over operations until her condition improved. The stall’s earnings still mainly go to her, but Mr Tan receives a portion of it for his help.

Others said that they tapped relatives to share the load and to make sure that the business remained sustainable.

A 66-year-old owner of Choon Hwa Coffee Stall in MacPherson, who declined to give her name, said that because she has high blood pressure and gets tired easily, her relatives help out on most mornings and afternoons, while she tends the stall in the evening.

She recounted how an NEA officer once approached her to find out why she was not at the stall.

She replied that it was “tough” for elderly people to man their stalls for hours on end and asked the officer to try a day of her work.

Another hawker said that she did not qualify for rental waivers when she fell sick last year, because her medical certificates did not cover her for a continuous period of one month.

Madam Jeanette Koh, 59, who operates a rojak store at Circuit Road Food Centre, said her absence at the stall also led to enquiries from NEA officers.

“NEA says if you can’t do it, then just return the stall to it. But if we return the stall (to NEA), then who will give us work? We don’t have credentials, who will hire us?”

One hawker who operates a stall at Toa Payoh Lorong 8 Market and Hawker Centre that sells ayam penyet (a fried chicken dish), said he was coughing for eight days, but he continued to work with a mask on in order to comply with NEA’s anti-subletting rule.

This was because he could not allow his assistants to work on his behalf while he was absent, he said. He declined to be named.

For similar reasons, it will also be difficult for him to leave Singapore for any Haj pilgrimages in future, because closing his stall when he is away means lost earnings.

This was a sentiment echoed by a few hawkers who feared losing potential earnings because they could not keep their stalls open with help from hired assistants while they rested at home.

For Ms Joanne Lee, 52, the owner of Fu He Turtle Soup at Berseh Food Centre, the requirement prevents her from extending her operating hours beyond 7pm to capture the supper crowd and earn more for her business.

“If I always have to be here all the time, it is difficult to sustain operations in the long run.”

Mr Melvin Chew, who owns the Jin Ji Teochew Braised Duck & Kway Chap stall at Chinatown Complex, said he worries for the future generation of hawkers since young people these days value work-life balance.

“In the past, old hawkers had no life. They simply worked every day and missed the time they had with their children,” the 47-year-old added.

“But nowadays, people feel that they should cherish the moment. So if they have to be at the stall every day from a certain time to a certain time, they have no freedom to spend time with their children or think about starting a family.”

He also said that if Singapore wants hawker culture to remain, then it has to provide younger hawkers with confidence that they can establish a branding for themselves and their businesses.

Not all agree, though. There were some hawkers, such as Mr Eddy Leck, who told CNA TODAY that it was possible to find that balance despite the long hours as a hawker.

For example, if there are no customers, there is no need for the stallholder to be present to work long hours. The hawker could close the stall and come back later when the crowds are back.

The 49-year-old owner of Soon Heng Coffee Stall at Circuit Road Food Centre said: ""I have no difficulties being here all the time. We are making a living, of course we have to be here. We're doing business.”

At the end of the day, hawker centres are designed to provide opportunities for hawkers to directly operate their own small food businesses, which is why corporates cannot bid directly for hawker stalls.

Some leeway is given for expansion opportunities. NEA’s current rules allow individuals to hold a maximum of two cooked food stalls in hawker centres, provided they are able to divide their time and operate the stalls personally.

In reality, executing this is difficult, some hawkers said.

Ms Li Ruifang, 41, recalled how her father gave up his prawn noodle stall at Whampoa Food Centre to help her find her footing in the food-and-beverage industry when she decided to start her own stall.

The earnings from his stall had put food on the table for her family since the 1970s. Originally, her father Lee Wong Leong, 75, wanted to retain ownership of his original stall and allow his sister to operate it, while he would head to Ms Li’s stall in Tekka Centre to help out full-time.

For a time, this was an ideal arrangement for them. Mr Lee’s earnings from Whampoa allowed him to keep a stable income, his daughter gets to learn directly from an experienced hand, and his sister gets to help out in the family business.

Then, NEA found out about the arrangement in 2014, and because Mr Lee could not divide his time commuting between the two stalls due to his age, he turned over ownership of his Whampoa stall to his sister.

Ms Li said of her father’s sacrifice: “I do feel very grateful for how he gave up his stall to come over to Tekka to help me out. If not for him, I believe it would have taken a longer time for me to get into the rhythm of helming the stall.”

Acknowledging the effectiveness of NEA’s rule against subletting, experts on hawker culture said it would be difficult to remove such a regulation without hurting the industry as a whole.

Doing so would also risk “unintended misuse” by hawkers, Mr Ryan Kueh said. He is the author of From Streets to Stalls, a book about the history and evolution of Singapore’s hawker culture.

Without such a rule, it would inadvertently give rise to subletting, allowing people to exploit public subsidies for personal profit by turning stalls into rental assets.

“We first need to consider its underlying principle – preventing the misappropriation of a public good for profiteering,” he said.

On the other hand, there could be “some flexibility for elderly hawkers or those facing genuine difficulties”, he added.

On this point, Dr Kong from SMU had some suggestions for the authorities to consider.

For example, there may be provisions for workers to take vacation leave in ways that do not affect their income.

“It is not unreasonable to have some provision for ‘locums’ to stand in occasionally for hawkers or for helpers to hold the fort for periods of time,” Dr Kong said.

Mr Kueh lauded NEA’s recent policy to allow hawkers to hire assistants holding long-term visit passes, which helps to ease workloads.

Previously, only Singapore citizens and permanent residents could work as stall assistants in hawker centres managed by NEA and its appointed operators. Hawkers could also hire their spouses who have these visit passes.

The policy was relaxed from Jan 1 to allow hawkers to hire any of these pass holders who have been approved to work here.

Beyond policy, Mr Kueh said more must be done to boost the attractiveness of the industry to young entrants.

“The larger issue is our outdated expectations of hawkers – expecting stalls to be open excessively for long hours or to sell food at very low prices – and the second-order effects they create,” he added.

“These expectations pressure hawkers to offer food at low costs and in turn receive low (profit) margins, endure excessively long working hours and remain trapped in a cycle of working more to sustain sufficient income.”",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/today/ground-up/ground-up-other-side-nea-subletting-law-hawkers-personally-operate-5131121,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z
CNA,How my eczema taught me that there's no shame in giving up some dreams to take care of myself,"In April 2023, I was looking forward to my first-ever snowboarding trip. I had wanted to do it for a while, but had always put it off because I had reservations with dry weather – a necessary caution for me due to my eczema.

Eczema first appeared on the skin around my eyes when I was 16. Later on, I was diagnosed with atopic dermatitis on other parts of my body. The usual suspects would be the crooks of the elbows, behind the knees, armpits – any areas of the body that are extra susceptible to trapped perspiration.

Earlier this year, I was also diagnosed with dyshidrotic eczema, also known as pompholyx eczema. It manifests on the hands and feet, and is associated with excessive hand-washing, use of sanitisers and emotional stress.

Mine manifests on my hands and is exacerbated in dry weather. Because of that, spending 10 days in the snowy mountains is a lot less fun for me than for the average person.

Nevertheless, I had the belief that I could do anything as long as I put my mind to it. I decided I wouldn’t let anything stop me from checking snowboarding off my bucket list, so I booked my plane ticket to France.

Each day, we went for snowboarding lessons, and each evening, I would wince in the shower, trying to wash my hair with my cracked fingertips.

When I went to bed each night, I would carefully position my hands palms facing up so I wouldn’t dirty my sheets with the sticky moisturiser I slathered on to heal and soothe my inflamed skin.

Honestly, the trip was great and I made many new friends, but I spent all 10 days smiling through my pain – my constant, relentless pain.

I still believed I could do anything I wanted if I put my mind to it.

However, on that trip, I realised: just because I can, doesn’t mean I should.

When I returned to Singapore, my energy levels crashed. I had to spend a few days “hibernating”, recovering the physical, mental and emotional energy drained from me over 10 days of coping with my aggravated skin problems.

So much for a holiday.

Eczema is fairly common in Singapore, affecting one in five children and one in 10 adults. I’m just one of hundreds of thousands that suffer from this condition – and this number is only increasing with each year.

For more than 10 years, eczema has been a constant (if somewhat inconsistent) presence in my life. Then, as I grew older, I started noticing that it was taking longer to heal between flare-ups.

In 2021, at age 26, I had yet another flare-up on my hands. I defaulted to my usual management strategy – topical steroid creams and moisturiser.

Two to three years on, I realised that my skin had never seemed to fully recover. It was only getting worse each time.

In January this year, strange-looking blisters called vesicles started appearing on my hands, taking my discomfort to a new peak.

Getting on with my life became cumbersome and painful. Even the simplest of tasks became agonising ordeals – tying my shoelaces, preparing meals, cleaning and so on.

The worst was whenever I had to wash my hands or take a shower. Water and soap would seep into the cracks on my fingers and hands, and every single time, it would sting and burn.

On top of this, my hands itched several times throughout each day. I had to start dedicating more energy to just ignoring it; a simple lapse in willpower might result in me scratching and breaking my skin.

I often find myself unable to control myself in sleep, so when I wake up the next day, I feel a wave of guilt but also lethargy.

I have to force myself to stay alert throughout the day, to get through my tasks at work or at home. I become more anxious when my condition worsens, which makes it even harder to heed my doctor’s advice to avoid stress.

Enduring this discomfort every single day sapped my energy and left me exhausted and empty. When I was younger, I would tell myself that I just needed to “push through” it, but that only led me to burnout.

Nowadays, I’m much more prudent with my stores of energy.

Still, it’s easy to fall back into the trap of thinking that I need to be more productive, that I need to push myself to the limit to achieve more.

After all, so many narratives in the public eye seem to exalt such actions.

The reality is that eczema, as well as countless other chronic illnesses, places a huge mental load on sufferers, affecting and shaping their lifestyles.

The cognitive and emotional effort involved in managing daily life, especially household chores, multiplies manifold but remains invisible.

I’d read about other patients with very severe eczema who need round-the-clock care, special baths and a cocktail of pills to even survive. Influencer Tammie Ong doesn’t have eczema, but has several other incurable, chronic conditions – she even has to ingest nutrients through a tube.

I can scarcely imagine the mental load that she and other chronic disease sufferers have on top of the toll exacted by their physical impairments and debilitations.

When I cook, I have to take extra effort to find recipes that require minimal preparation. In buying groceries, I fork out more for pre-chopped ingredients to avoid having to handle and wash them too much.

I try to stick to exercise options that don’t require me to use my hands a lot – standing HIIT workouts, for instance, or stair training.

I had to get a strap to carry my mobile phone everywhere with me, for the days when digging into my pockets is simply too painful.

And of course, I worry often about costly medical fees.

All this greatly frustrated me at first. Now, I’m learning to come to terms with my new reality and focus on the positives.

I’m aware that I’m in a much better position than many others, for instance. I count myself lucky that there are varied treatment options that are accessible to me and that I’m able to work in an air-conditioned environment.

My loved ones patiently support me and pick up the slack – my mother and grandfather always pack extra portions of food for me when I visit, and my partner pre-cuts my fruits and veggies so I can have easy access to them.

I’ve also learnt to start celebrating my own efforts, no matter how small the task seems. I’m learning to applaud myself for keeping my spaces clean and for working out even though I could easily call it a day on account of my eczema.

One of the advantages of being stubbornly determined is that it still doesn’t completely stop me from doing what I want.

At the start of this year, I went on my second snowboarding trip.

It was a lot more painful than the first, given that my eczema has intensified over the last few years. Everything was worse: Showers were more unbearable, the dry air seemed to siphon moisture out of my skin even through layers of moisturiser, and I had many teary fits of sheer frustration.

Strangely enough, I still don’t regret it.

I’m sure it won’t be the last snowboarding trip of my life, but for now, it is goodbye.

I can look forward to the many other new experiences awaiting me in future, but in the meantime, I need to focus on taking care of myself.

There’s no shame in listening to my body and letting go of something I want to pursue so I can care for my well-being.

CNA,"Love them, but not too much: SPCA's longest-serving employee on coping with the ups and downs of handling animals for 46 years","It would be easy to make the mistaken assumption that Mr Pribakaran Kunju joined the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) Singapore to answer a personal calling, given that he has served there for almost five decades.

The truth is, this longest-serving employee at the animal welfare organisation started out afraid of dogs and did not have any particular affinity for other furry creatures.

Mr Pribakaran, who turns 69 this month and is married with children, had stumbled upon the job opportunity during a chance meeting with an old friend back in 1979.

“My friend had asked me, ‘Do you want a job at SPCA?’ And I replied, ‘What is SPCA?’” he told me candidly.

Despite his initial hesitation at signing up for a job involving animals, Mr Pribakaran eventually agreed to go for an interview with his friend, who promised him that he would have nothing to fear because they would be working side by side.

However, he had to confront his phobia from the moment he stepped into the SPCA office, then located along Orchard Road, for the job interview in November 1979.

“The dogs all rushed to me. You know what I did? I was very frightened, so I went and hugged my friend. ‘I don't want, I don't want. The dogs, all coming, smelling, smelling'.” he recounted. “Wah, I was very scared.”

Fast forward 46 years and you could say Mr Pribakaran is a changed man.

For one whole morning at the SPCA grounds along Sungei Tengah Road recently, I observed how the senior shelter executive effortlessly helped to clean the cat enclosures and feed them while lovingly petting them.

He also took a dog for a walk around the premises that morning, all his old fears having vanished through the years of working with the creatures and falling in love with them.

Growing up, his family had never kept any pets and he “never interacted” with animals when he was younger, Mr Pribakaran told me.

“Once a dog barked, I would run, move away from that,” he said. “We didn’t want to get near the dogs.”

After National Service, Mr Pribakaran began working in the shipping industry, where he was paid by the day and was given shifts only when there was work to be done.

So when he bumped into the friend who said there was a job opportunity at SPCA offering a stable monthly salary, Mr Pribakaran's curiosity was piqued despite his aversion to dogs.

And indeed, that friend stood by him and reassured him in those early days on the job, when Mr Pribakaran had to learn to bathe dogs at the shelter and get used to being around them every day.

“I was doing it slowly, slowly. And he would tell me, ‘Don’t worry, it won’t bite’,” he recalled.

“Of course, to him, it won‘t bite. But for me, how would I know if the dog would bite or not?”

Mr Pribakaran’s friend worked alongside him at SPCA for more than a decade, but the friend resigned due to health issues. They continued keeping in touch until the friend died some years later.

Through the years, Mr Pribakaran has worked in various roles and performed many duties at SPCA.

He started as an animal care officer, also known back then as a kennel keeper. His main tasks included bathing the animals and their enclosures. He progressively took on other duties, such as being a driver for the company's vehicles and later on, became a supervisor to younger officers as well.

Now, as a senior shelter executive, his main task involves following up on reports of pets that were lost or found, calling up the owners to get more information from them and eventually reuniting them with the animals.

Through constant training and exposure, Mr Pribakaran has not only overcome his fear of dogs but also become adept at handling them. He has even pulled off several successful dog rescues, including in dangerous situations.

One of the most memorable incidents that he could recall was when he rescued a dog from an MRT train track.

It was about 20 years ago and he was at church with his family on a Sunday when SPCA received an urgent call for help.

“So I told my wife that I'm going to the rescue. Because that’s our job, even when we are eating, when they say there’s an injured animal, we just put the food aside and we will go tend to the emergency,” he said.

Mr Pribakaran said the situation was particularly stressful because he was given only a few minutes to complete the rescue, to minimise further disruption to the train schedule.

“It was very dangerous and I was so scared, because there was (a rail carrying) electric current along the side. If I made a misstep, even slightly, anything may have happened,” he recounted.

He could not recall more details from the episode, such as the exact location where it occurred, or what happened to the dog after the rescue. He just remembered that he somehow pulled off the rescue despite the odds.

Another memorable – but unpleasant – incident, also around 20 years ago, was when he rescued an abandoned German shepherd dog.

As the colleague assisting him did not hold on to the leash properly, the dog bit Mr Pribakaran while he was lifting it into the van.

“Very bad, the hand, very bad. I just sat down and cried,” he said of the injury he sustained from the bite.

I asked if that incident re-triggered his past fear of dogs, but he said it didn’t and that he was fine after a couple of days.

“I never thought, ‘I don't want to work (anymore)’ ... because it was just an animal and the mistake was already made. After that, we were very careful,” he said.

Today, Mr Pribakaran is no longer involved in rescue works, but I could still see his years of accumulated experience on full display when we spent the morning together.

He was cleaning around five cat enclosures, one after another, so swiftly that he probably completed his task faster than I usually take to clean my cats’ two litter boxes at home.

Just as speedily, he prepared food and fed a few cats in the shelter, and even took time to pat and play with them a little.

Such tasks, I learnt, are not the main part of his job scope, which is to help reunite owners and their lost pets, but Mr Pribakaran does it anyway to lend a helping hand to other staff members and volunteers.

In the last financial year ending June 2024, SPCA took in 1,155 animals that were either rescued or surrendered by members of the public. In that period, 459 were either reunited with their owners or released back into the community.

Handling cases of lost pets can be a delicate task, he said.

“I've come across (cases) where, before I talked, the owner already started crying, ‘Woo woo woo’.”

He told of how he always takes time to soothe the pet owner first, so that they can calm down enough to communicate every possible detail that might be useful in recovering their pets.

He also advises them on practical steps they may take to improve their chances of finding their lost pets, such putting up posters around their neighbourhood and online.

How long it takes to find lost pets really varies from case to case, but the joy of reunion is a constant, he said.

“You know, when the owners sit down, we take the dog here, then the dog will run and jump to them and kiss them. Immediately, we know for sure already, this dog belongs to them. So that's a happy, happy ending for the dog and owner.

“So we’re also very happy because the dog is returning to the right home.”

After a few years of handling dogs and vanquishing his fear of them, Mr Pribakaran even adopted one at the encouragement of his supervisor.

“It was a Pekingese, but it didn’t have one eye, had one eye only. I took care of the dog, it stayed with me for about 10 to 12 years, then got sick and passed on,” he said.

“After my pet died, I did not feel like I wanted to keep another one, because the feeling (of loss) was very bad.”

I could empathise with this completely. I lost one of my pet cats seven years ago. It died of cancer. Till today, I still have a photo of it as the digital wallpaper on my tablet, while my parents, still affected by the loss, resolved not to take in any more cats.

When I asked how he coped with the many losses he has undoubtedly encountered in his 46 years working at SPCA – last year alone, 177 sick animals died in shelter care at SPCA – Mr Pribakaran said the key is to love them without getting too attached.

Through the years, he has seen many injured animals being taken into the shelter and eventually dying. In such moments, he said, he would usually be comforted by the thought that the veterinarians had tried their best to give these animals a fighting chance.

This approach of love without attachment helps him cope not only when he has to witness an animal's death, but also when he has to separate from an animal for happier reasons.

“I give you an example. If I love the cat too much, if the cat goes home (to its owners), I would feel sad because I’m separated from it. But I don't, I am happy because the cat gets to go home, the dog gets to go home.”

On the flip side, Mr Pribakaran said that he gets “very sad” whenever he reads about cases of abandonment, neglect and cruelty.

Last year, SPCA saw animal cruelty and welfare cases soar to a 12-year high of 961 confirmed cases.

“We’re very sad, but what can we do about it? We just try our best for the next animal,” he said, adding that he wishes prospective pet owners would think very carefully before taking in pets, because they are life-long commitments.

Wrapping up our conversation that morning, I asked him what his advice was for career longevity, as someone who has spent almost five decades at one organisation.

He told me that the key is to find a job that you love and find meaning in it, because when it is meaningful, this will eventually outweigh other considerations. At least, that has been the case for him.

Although he first took on a role at SPCA because he needed income stability, it was his love for the job and animals that has kept him rooted in the organisation through the years.

“When it comes to work, people might say, ‘I must have S$5,000, S$10,000, then I work’,” he said.

“For me, if it’s S$200 or S$100, I’ll still work. Because why? It’s for the animals that I stay, that is one thing that makes me stay for over 40 years.”",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/today/up-close/spca-longest-serving-employee-handling-animals-5134071,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z
CNA,The dangers of relying too much on someone else to tell you what to do with your money,"For most of us, trying to figure out how best to manage our money can be overwhelming. Just like how most of us learnt how to spend and save our primary school allowance from our parents, we seek out people who have already done it before us as a guide.

We watch videos, browse forums and devour content from blogs, hoping to learn from others’ experiences (and, hopefully, avoid their mistakes).

It’s no wonder that “finfluencers” – online creators specialising in content about financial literacy and breaking down complex financial concepts for the layman to understand – have become so popular in recent years.

In an October 2024 survey by MoneySmart website, more than half of Singaporeans aged 18 and above said they relied on platforms such as YouTube, Instagram, Facebook and TikTok for financial advice, preferring them over traditional sources such as family, friends and financial advisers.

The internet has made financial advice more accessible than ever. We cannot ignore the benefits of such resources, especially if we were never taught these things in school or at home.

However, just as we’re encouraged to consult doctors rather than relying solely on health advice found on the internet, no one should be relying on financial advice online for their own financial decisions.

In March, Chocolate Finance customers experienced a temporary liquidity delay following mass withdrawals caused by online panic.

The financial services company had marketed itself as an attractive high-yield alternative for investors who want to park their money with it and earn returns as high as 3 per cent to 5 per cent per annum through a managed investment portfolio.

It gained popularity quickly, receiving favourable reviews on social media and internet forums.

However, when a few YouTube videos about several prominent finfluencers withdrawing their Chocolate Finance funds went viral, customers got worried and wondered if the platform was truly safe, resulting in massive withdrawals within a day or so.

The company could no longer afford to continue supporting instant withdrawals, leading to further panic when many users found themselves told to wait a few days before their money would land in their bank accounts.

None of the public’s initial fears about the platform materialised – all customers who requested withdrawals during the height of the meltdown, between Mar 10 and Mar 18, got their money back within a week or two.

However, the incident raised questions about how online sentiment could so quickly lead to a liquidity crunch in a regulated financial firm.

The Chocolate Finance saga highlighted a broader issue with personal finance today. And it is that so many of us seem to have a tendency to make snap investment decisions based on little more than a short video or blog post.

A fresh graduate saving for a wedding should not follow the same investment strategy as someone nearing retirement. A dual-income household with no kids will have different insurance needs from a single parent.

What works for one person might be unsuitable – or even harmful – for another. Yet, much of the financial content online presents examples, scenarios or success stories without always highlighting these distinctions.

To be fair, we cannot realistically expect all content to do so sufficiently. Such advice, designed and packaged for online consumption, must be broad so as to appeal to the largest possible group of viewers or readers.

This doesn’t invalidate such content, but it does call for critical thinking from us as viewers and consumers.

Short videos and posts can only convey so much, and even the most well-meaning advice may not apply to everyone’s situation.

“Save 30 per cent of your salary” seems like sound advice, but for someone already struggling to make ends meet, this is hardly feasible.

This is not a flaw of online financial advice, but rather a reminder that all advice, whether found online or offline, must be interpreted through the lens of individual context.

Just because there are people who post videos on TikTok to talk about how they grew their portfolio by investing in cryptocurrency doesn’t mean you should blindly follow suit.

In response to the Chocolate Finance fallout, many have called for tighter regulations on finfluencers and financial content online.

There’s good intent behind this. Financial advice should always be responsibly given, and content creators who promote products should be transparent – especially if there’s a commercial relationship involved.

However, regulation alone isn’t the fix. Even before the advent of social media, licensed professionals have been known to cross ethical lines or mislead their clients.

A Great Eastern insurance agent was jailed last year after misappropriating more than S$300,000 from his clients by forging insurance documents and redirecting funds. In 2018 and 2019, two former personal bankers with United Overseas Bank separately received jail sentences for cheating their clients of hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Their victims weren’t deceived by TikTok videos and Instagram carousels. They were misled by people with credentials, who wore suits and worked in bank branches and corporate offices.

Official qualifications and titles do not guarantee integrity either. Misalignment of incentives, pressure to meet sales targets or personal misconduct can lead to poor advice – even in regulated environments.

Bad financial advice doesn’t just live online. It can come from anywhere, even your well-meaning aunt at family gatherings.

The more empowering and sustainable approach is to understand that the only person who will always have your best financial interests at heart is yourself.

Taking ownership of your finances means more than just watching YouTube videos or reading a few blog posts. We can’t always blame someone else for our decisions, even if they have influenced our thinking.

Six years ago, I bought a resale Housing and Development Board (HDB) flat because I was worried about stretching my finances too thin, despite my property agent advising me that a resale condominium unit across the street was a much better deal.

Six years on, I’m watching the owners of the condo unit across the street walk away with a S$400,000 gain, while my HDB flat has barely appreciated in value.

Despite my regrets, I’m in no position to blame my agent. Ultimately, I made the call for myself.

It can be a hard pill to swallow, but what we choose to do with our money is up to us – not that influencer with the slick Instagram feed, or the financial adviser pushing you to buy a policy by month’s end, and definitely not the strangers in Telegram groups hyping up the next “sure win” investment.

So the next time you see a viral TikTok about a ""sure-win"" investment, remember this: Not all financial advice is bad, but not all financial advice is meant for you.

Don’t just ask yourself, “Is this good?” Ask yourself, “Is this good for me?”

We must stay curious, choose wisely and never outsource our personal financial responsibility to anyone else.

CNA,Adoption of autonomous vehicles is one race Singapore is not keen on winning,"In San Francisco today, booking a car ride does not necessarily mean having a driver pick you up at your location. Instead, you might open the Waymo One mobile application, enter your destination, and within minutes, a silent and driverless car will pull up, and there is no one behind the wheel.

What was once a scene from the Netflix sci-fi series Black Mirror has now become a way of life there.

Waymo is a subsidiary of Alphabet, the parent company of Google, and it operates one of the world’s largest commercial robotaxi services.

The company’s robotaxis now clock more than 250,000 rides each week across cities in the United States such as Austin, Los Angeles, Phoenix and San Francisco. In April, Waymo began hitting the streets of Tokyo in Japan, one of its first international locations.

In Guangzhou, China, a similar experience unfolds with self-driving giant WeRide, where a few effortless taps on your mobile phone will summon a car that arrives quietly, without a driver. All you need is a passcode and you are on your way.

WeRide’s autonomous technology also powers larger vehicles such as its fully autonomous eight-seater robobus.

Ms Tan Shi Hui, 33, who took the robobus during a business trip to the southern Chinese city last year, found the ride surprisingly ordinary.

“I felt quite calm throughout. The acceleration and deceleration were smooth, there were no sudden jerks, and even the turns felt gentle,” the independent consultant said, adding that she did not even feel “a hint of anxiety” when on the bus.

The large window panels on all sides allowed her to see clearly what was happening outside on the road, which made the journey feel reassuring, Ms Tan recalled.

Similarly, Mr Wu Linhan and his wife, Ms Amandine Honvault, both 28, tried Baidu Apollo's self-driving taxis when they were in Guangzhou back in 2023.

Baidu Apollo is the autonomous driving platform developed by Baidu, a leading Chinese technology company.

""It felt like stepping into the future, especially when you see the car turning without anyone's help,"" Mr Wu, a freelance video and photo editor, said.

Ms Honvault, a software engineer, said that they both felt safe because the taxi was not going fast or weaving through heavy traffic.

""We knew someone was checking our itinerary and double-checking that we don't have issues,"" she added.

Hearing of such developments, where integrated autonomous vehicles (AVs) have become a part of everyday transport, it would seem that Singapore is lagging behind, even though it is often viewed as a global leader in smart technology.

Since 2015, Singapore has been facilitating on-road AV trials, but these have been primarily at controlled sites such as closed campuses or shuttle loops at Ngee Ann Polytechnic or Resorts World Sentosa.

Under current regulations, AVs can only be operated as part of authorised trials. Private ownership or public use of driverless cars remains prohibited.

Even so, experts told CNA TODAY that Singapore’s more deliberate and cautious approach towards AV testing, though more “demanding”, prioritises safety and builds up confidence for users with the technology.

Mr Daniel Chow, principal at consulting firm Arthur D Little Southeast Asia, said: “Singapore is not the first to deploy autonomous vehicles, but it may be one of the first to get it right.”

Mr Chow, who advises his firm's clients on business growth among other areas, added that Singapore’s “slowness” in deploying AVs stems from various factors, including the need to build confidence in operating them on bus routes, ensuring public transport operators can train workers effectively and assuring commuters that the technology has been thoroughly tested before going mainstream.

Indeed, in response to queries from CNA TODAY, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) said that while countries such as the US and China have deployed fleets of AVs as robotaxis, safety remains the key focus in Singapore.

“Safety is paramount and our priority is to ensure the local operating environment is suitable to facilitate their deployment in a safe manner, while also addressing issues related to public acceptance of such technology,” the authority added.

It also said that its first phase of AV deployment will focus on fixed-route shuttles such as road-sweeping and logistics AVs.

“LTA will ensure all safety and public acceptability issues are adequately addressed first, before moving on to other more complex use cases like robotaxis,” it added.

Mr Soh Ming, founder and managing director of Volt Auto, the authorised distributor of Dongfeng automobiles in Singapore, said: “The cautious approach makes sense, because in a dense city like Singapore, you don't just roll out autonomous technology without being absolutely sure it's safe.

“There’s no room for error.”

Dongfeng, one of the largest car manufacturers in China, has been actively developing autonomous driving technology with trials involving robotaxis, autonomous trucks and smart mobility solutions as part of its push into next-generation transport.

“We are moving slowly, but we are moving with intent. When Singapore does scale AVs, it will be with a system that is tested, integrated and trusted,” Mr Soh added.

Self-driving technology has made significant progress in recent years around the world, reaching a baseline maturity that enables it to operate on many urban roads without human drivers.

These autonomous vehicles can follow traffic rules, change lanes, react to traffic lights and avoid obstacles or pedestrians. However, AVs still need human oversight in complex scenarios such as extreme weather, unpredictable human behaviour or unusual road conditions.

Currently, most AVs that exist are classified at Level 3 or Level 4 autonomy, based on the six levels of driving automation established by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), recognised as the global standard.

Level 0 refers to full human control of the vehicle. Level 5, the highest, represents full autonomy, where the vehicle can operate on any road and under all conditions without any human intervention.

With AV technology advancing rapidly, some countries such as China, Japan and the US have embraced autonomous vehicles extensively and are scaling up their commercial operations.

Besides Waymo in San Francisco, Amazon subsidiary Zoox is preparing to expand production of its purpose-built autonomous vehicles, which feature bidirectional driving and no steering wheel.

Similarly, in China, car manufacturer Xpeng has launched the P7+, an electric vehicle featuring the company's XNGP autonomous driving system.

Unlike rival systems, Xpeng’s does not rely on LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), a technology that uses laser pulses to create precise 3D maps of the environment, but which can be costly and bulky.

Instead, Xpeng’s system relies on a combination of cameras, ultrasonic sensors and radar to navigate complex urban conditions.

WeRide has expanded rapidly beyond China, launching robotaxi services in Abu Dhabi in partnership with ride-hailing firm Uber. It plans to extend operations to Dubai and 15 other cities globally over the next five years.

The company has also received approval in China to operate fully unmanned paid ride-hailing services in Beijing, and it holds permits for passenger rides, highway driving and remote driverless operations in Guangzhou.

Competitor Pony.ai is not far behind; at the Auto Shanghai 2025 exhibition recently, the company unveiled its seventh-generation autonomous driving system, which allows for 100 per cent mass production of robotaxis to automotive standards.

In China, Pony.ai has reduced production costs of its AV systems by 70 per cent, bringing the company closer to profitability and making mass robotaxi deployment more commercially viable.

In Singapore, various testbeds have been rolled out across the island over the years. These include autonomous shuttle trials on Sentosa Island, campus-based deployments at the National University of Singapore and One-north, and small-scale commercial pilots such as NTUC FairPrice Group’s collaboration with logistics partner Zelos.

To address the decreasing number of truck drivers, FairPrice Group Supply Chain Business began deploying the Zelos Z10, the first fully driverless autonomous vehicle designed for the logistics sector, to transfer pallets of goods between its warehouses in Joo Koon in October 2024.

Since April 2024, WeRide Robobus has been deployed at selected hours as a pilot service to ferry passengers around Resorts World Sentosa.

Over at Ngee Ann Polytechnic, MooVita, a software provider of autonomous driving technology, has been providing autonomous shuttle services within the campus since January 2023.

To boost productivity and improve the working conditions of its employees, cleaning service Chye Thiam Maintenance has deployed the WeRide S1 Robosweeper to sweep the outdoor areas of The Esplanade and the WeRide S6 Robosweeper for road sweeping in the Marina Coastal Drive area since October 2024.

Singapore’s approach to AV integration is supported by the Centre of Excellence for Testing and Research of Autonomous Vehicles-NTU (CETRAN), established in August 2016.

CETRAN serves as a dedicated facility for testing and certifying AVs, ensuring that safety assessments are conducted before deployment on public roads.

Last November, during the Singapore International Transport Congress & Exhibition 2024, Minister for Transport Chee Hong Tat talked about Singapore's progress in the AV space, reiterating that safety is the nation's top priority when assessing the deployment of the technology for commercial use cases.

Even though Singapore would like to ""move more quickly"", the current ""calibrated and data-driven approach"" is best given its dense urban environment and to ensure that the different elements of the ecosystem are ready, he said.

As for robotaxis, Mr Chee said the authorities remained open to exploring them, but he added that the ones offering point-to-point services are more complex to deploy safely compared with AVs that operate with fixed routes.

For now, trials will focus on AVs operating on defined routes, such as logistics vehicles and minibuses. However, if fixed-route robotaxis prove commercially viable, LTA would be open to exploring those as well, Mr Chee added.

""As technology continues to mature and public confidence grows, we will be able to scale up deployment across more routes and more use cases, including the possibility of full-fledged robotaxis in future,"" he said.

In January this year, LTA issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) to pilot autonomous public bus services. The initiative aims to assess the technical feasibility of AV technology for public bus services and gain insights into operational aspects at both service and fleet levels.

The pilot will start with smaller buses of at least 16 seats on bus service 400, which runs around the Shenton Way bus terminal, and bus service 191, which loops from Buona Vista Bus terminal to Media Circle in One-north.

These areas were chosen for their shorter and simpler routes.

The RFP states that the buses will initially operate with bus drivers onboard as safety operators, with the possibility of moving to remote supervision after demonstrating reliability for at least six months.

LTA plans to procure six autonomous buses for a start, with operations set to begin in mid-2026 for an initial period of three years. Depending on their performance, up to 14 more buses may be acquired to expand the pilot to two more services.

Other AV initiatives involving Singapore companies include ComfortDelGro’s first robotaxi pilot programme in Guangzhou, which was launched in partnership with Pony.ai.

The two-year pilot, initiated in March this year, aims to develop and refine capabilities for autonomous vehicle technology operations and fleet management, with the goal of large-scale deployment in China and other international markets.

ComfortDelGro, Singapore's largest taxi operator, said in response to queries from CNA TODAY that the robotaxis have been ""well-received"" by the public in Guangzhou, with consistent daily numbers.

So far, the pilot has experienced zero at-fault traffic incidents and zero passenger incidents, it added.

""The technology has demonstrated that it can adapt and manoeuvre well in mixed traffic and weather conditions with minimal virtual assistance, ensuring a smooth and safe ride for passengers,"" ComfortDelGro said.

""The lessons learnt would be useful for application in Singapore and other parts of the world when regulations permit in the future.""

On whether ComfortDelGro will introduce its robotaxis to Singapore as well, the company said that for the robotaxis to be commercially viable on a larger scale, the technology will have to be mature enough for safe mixed-environment driving, supported by strong regulation and public trust.

""We have seen successful case studies of robotaxis on the road in China, San Francisco and other parts of the world. However, for it to take off on a more significant scale globally, it would require wider public acceptance and a stronger push at the policy level.""

While other cities might be racing ahead to integrate autonomous vehicles into their public transport systems, Singapore’s “slow” approach reflects the city’s dense and highly complex environment, experts said.

Mr Alex Tang, head of Xpeng's international division of sales and service in Singapore, said: “Bringing AV technology to a densely populated and highly regulated environment like Singapore requires a deliberate, step-by-step approach.”

It is crucial to consider the unique characteristics of Singapore's urban landscape, including its high traffic density, diverse mix of road users who include those on personal mobility devices and the weather conditions here, he added.

Dr Dan Chia, senior lecturer at the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT), said Singapore’s many pilot programmes and “step-wise” approach are also due to its lack of “greenfield spaces” as compared with other cities such as Guangzhou and San Francisco.

Greenfield spaces are undeveloped lands ideal for unrestricted design and testing.

Dr Chia, who researches AVs and intelligent transport systems, added: “China and the US have greenfield spaces to play in, where areas and surroundings can be clearly marked without too much public interaction. But in Singapore, it's difficult, since we lack a true greenfield to test AV tech.

“A step-wise approach may seem a little bit slower compared to overseas cities, but this reduces the danger and unwanted accidents, given the more complex scenarios in Singapore.”

Although the island's density might seem like a roadblock to adopting autonomous vehicles, Mr Chow from Arthur D Little Southeast Asia said that it is ""our proving ground"" and works to the country's advantage in its foray into AV technology.

“Autonomous vehicles in Singapore have to navigate tight, highly dense and complex environments ... if you can make autonomous technology work here, you can make it work in most urban environments.""

Agreeing, Mr Tang from Xpeng said the city’s well-regulated roads and high compliance with traffic rules offer a “conducive environment” for deploying and refining autonomous systems.

Dr Chia said that deploying public buses is a more challenging endeavour than robotaxis, due to real-life scenarios and “occlusions” that are difficult to test for, as well as the high expectations people have for public transport.

Occlusions are situations where a vehicle’s sensors are blocked or cannot clearly detect objects, people or other vehicles.

“When you talk about public roads, the speed of operation is different and the environment is more complex because you will have more occlusions,” Dr Chia said, citing situations such as when cyclists appear unexpectedly.

He noted that Singapore’s cautious approach is also because AV buses face more challenging demands than robotaxis, which carry just a few passengers. Buses must handle larger passenger volumes and, if standing passengers are allowed, smooth acceleration and braking become critical to avoid injuries.

Furthermore, even if the technology and testing proceed as planned, large-scale deployment of autonomous vehicles requires an “ecosystem” to ensure long-term business viability.

Developing an AV transport system does not rely on technology alone – it requires “many moving parts that need to move together in concert”, Mr Chow said.

Agreeing, Mr Tang said Singapore presents unique challenges that would require significant and sustained investments, “not just in physical infrastructure, but also in digital systems and urban design that support safe and efficient AV operations”.

“It's a confluence of different factors. The government can certainly try to orchestrate (the developments), like it currently does with electric vehicles and electrification,” Mr Chow added, noting that the upcoming RFP from LTA is a “step in the right direction”.

“Going forward, you'll need an ecosystem approach where all of the various actors and players within the transport and mobility ecosystem invest capital, invest time and invest resources to make it happen.”

Even with successful trials, Dr Chia cautioned that deploying AV buses is “not so straightforward”. It can be costly and complex, requiring specialised expertise, extensive training and high overheads, making it a business that needs “deep pockets”.
“This business model is very different from typical bus services provided by operators like Tower Transit or under the SBS model,” he said.

“Existing bus drivers do not have the technical expertise to operate AV buses, and the technological requirements are far beyond the current baseline.”

Dr Chia noted that AV buses are far more expensive to purchase than conventional models and may not turn a profit for years, even if they run 24 hours a day, assuming that maintenance costs are manageable.

Professor Zhao Jinhua, the lead principal investigator of Mens, Manus and Machina, an interdisciplinary research group at the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology, said that scaling autonomous vehicles safely remains ""a formidable challenge”.

“As AV fleets grow, the ability to maintain them efficiently becomes crucial.”

Prof Zhao said this extends beyond software and includes the physical upkeep of vehicles and robotic systems, which are needed to perform tasks such as cleaning, charging, diagnostics and repairs of the fleet for minimal downtime.

“Automating these operational tasks is a foundational step toward making AV deployment not just technologically feasible, but economically sustainable.”

AVs, once seen as belonging only in the 1960s American cartoon series The Jetsons, are now a reality that can provide flexible and responsive transportation, help ease manpower shortages through round-the-clock operation and enhance road safety with advanced sensors and strict adherence to traffic rules.

“Singapore is uniquely poised to implement AVs in a way that supports public good,” Prof Zhao said.

Using AVs as public transport could be the “most impactful and efficient” application of the technology, he added.

“These high-occupancy vehicles can significantly reduce per-passenger emissions and road usage, while also addressing first- and last-mile gaps in the public transport system using existing traffic infrastructure.”

However, these projections aside, Mr Chow said his company’s research has found that public acceptance of AVs lags behind their technical capability.

“Despite technological progress and demonstrable improved safety over human-driven tasks, the level of trust in autonomous driving technologies has not significantly increased over the past five years.”

Misconceptions contribute to the lack of acceptance, including the belief that driverless vehicles are already fully autonomous, will never fail and will make “cold, unethical choices”, he added.

“The biggest myth with autonomous vehicles is that they're either flawless or dangerous.”

Mr Chow also said that high-profile failures and extensive media coverage of such incidents have fuelled confusion and deepened consumers’ lack of trust in AVs.

In San Francisco earlier this year, for example, there was a high-speed crash involving seven vehicles, including an unaccompanied Waymo vehicle.

However, the crash had been caused by the driver of a Tesla, which collided with multiple vehicles, and the driver was later arrested. The accident resulted in the death of a 27-year-old man and his dog, and injured seven others.

In October 2023, a self-driving car operated by US company Cruise ran over and dragged a pedestrian who had been struck by another car, leaving her seriously injured.

“Uncertainty lingers about the impact of widespread AV use,” Prof Zhao said.

He noted that AVs could have an impact on existing transportation challenges, such as traffic congestion, and could also reduce urban liveability or deepen mobility inequality, particularly for those who rely on shared or public modes of transport, if their deployment is not done carefully.

Therefore, researchers and institutions have a responsibility to communicate these issues clearly and to involve the public in shaping how these technologies evolve, Prof Zhao added.

“By engaging citizens, collaborating with policymakers and ensuring that human needs are central to AV design and deployment, we can foster greater trust and steer AV adoption towards more equitable and sustainable outcomes.”

Mr Lars Nielsen, managing Director of BMW Group Asia, said this initial resistance to AVs is similar to the hesitation seen in the early days of electric vehicles.

“It’s about educating our customers and gaining their trust in the technology by experiencing it themselves,” he said.

Mr Soh from Volt Auto said: “Public trust doesn't happen overnight; it's earned. For any new technology, whether electric or autonomous, the biggest question is, people always ask, ‘Is it safe?’

“Trust starts with familiar things.”

Mr Soh observed that during the early days of electric-vehicle adoption, he focused on explaining how the vehicles worked and how to care for the battery.

This openness helped build trust and allowed people to understand the technology, rather than only reacting when something went wrong.

LTA's move to call for a pilot deployment of AV minibuses marks a milestone, but Dr Chia said the next challenge is “to take away the safety driver and have it truly tele-operated”.

The ability to safely operate AVs without onboard staff members has been a key objective from the start, but society will also need time to adjust.

Beyond the technical hurdles, public education and familiarisation will be key to ensuring acceptance, Dr Chia added.

Younger commuters may adapt quickly, he reckoned.

“The harder part will definitely be for elders and people with disabilities to operate and interact with self-driving vehicles. That’s an area for more work.”

He noted that self-driving public transport may be harder for people with disabilities to use, because tasks now assisted by drivers, including boarding, would need to be automated, unlike in private vehicles where users are already familiar with the controls.

Mr Chow believes that the next phase of AVs in Singapore is not about “hype” anymore since the technology has already reached a level of maturity and has been deployed in other countries.

In addition to Singapore moving towards having AV buses monitored remotely, he said that commuters can also expect expansion to more bus routes and use cases such as midnight services or night feeder buses.

Mr Soh highlighted that beyond safety, a major concern about AVs is job displacement fears among drivers and those reliant on vehicle operation for income.

This is a valid concern, but he noted that in more mature AV markets, such as parts of China, it is a “more nuanced” situation.

For instance, in the city of Wuhan, some AVs are already on the road, but they are not fully independent.

Human operators are integral to the system, he added. They monitor and remotely intervene, allowing one person to manage multiple vehicles, sometimes three or four, from a control centre, creating new job roles.

“You’re no longer just a driver, you become an operator and potentially earn more because you’re supporting more vehicles and doing it in a safer, more controlled environment,” Mr Soh said.

This eliminates long hours on the road, reducing fatigue and high-stress traffic for drivers.

“The real conversation isn’t about replacement, it’s about redefinition … With the right training and support, it can be empowering rather than threatening. It’s about evolving the role, not eliminating it.”",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/today/big-read/big-read-self-driving-vehicles-5116971,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z
CNA,"‘Good debt’ may exist in theory, but it’s a different matter in reality","While doing a yearly review of my finances earlier this year, a financial adviser I met suggested buying an insurance policy that might yield attractive returns.

It was a tempting prospect but the annual premiums were beyond my means.

The financial adviser’s suggestion? Take a loan with an interest rate lower than the insurance policy’s potential returns.

I was bewildered by the notion as I had grown up being taught by my parents that taking on debt was to be avoided at all costs, if possible.

I had also read one too many reports warning that people can spiral into debt if they do not manage their loans well.

Speaking to this financial adviser, however, made me wonder if I was just being overly fearful of debt and if I could leverage such an option to my advantage.

In short, the answer is, don't do it unless you have money you are prepared to lose, because managing an investment and a loan together is double trouble that not many of us common folk are equipped to do.

Financial experts told CNA TODAY that debt, which can come in the form of a personal loan, housing loan or even a study loan, can be classified as ""healthy"" or ""unhealthy"", depending on the purpose of the loan, the amount borrowed and your financial standing.

Mr Lawrence Tan, a senior manager at the Institute for Financial Literacy, the outreach arm of national financial education programme MoneySense, said debts that fall in the ""healthy"" category should help meet basic needs such as education and housing, or have a productive purpose such as to generate income by starting a business.

“On the other side of the coin, taking on debt to fund something that is not a basic need – for example, to fund lifestyle expenses or buying something that is not core to your daily needs – can be considered unhealthy and even ‘bad’,” he said.

Whether it is ""good"" or ""bad"" debt also depends on your income streams and the amount of debt you have.

Ms Daphne Lye, financial planning solutions and investment management lead at MoneyOwl, a financial advisory firm that is part of Temasek Trust, said that it is ideal for your total debt servicing ratio to be under 35 per cent.

This ratio is the proportion of your gross monthly income that goes into repaying your debt obligations, including your monthly housing loan.

For example, if you take home S$3,000 before mandatory contributions to the Central Provident Fund, the amount you pay towards your debts should not be more than S$1,050 ideally.

Without the housing loan, Ms Lye said that loan repayments should not be more than 15 per cent of your take-home pay.

“As part of our financial health, we should limit the overall quantum of debt – even good debt – to be manageable so we do not find ourselves in an overly stressed financial situation,” she added.

Even with ""good"" debt, the experts said there are things to look out for before taking a loan.

Mr Mark Tan, head of commercial for financial website MoneySmart Financial, said these include the interest rates that are charged and the monthly repayments, which should “comfortably fit within your budget to avoid financial strain”.

Be aware as well of hidden costs such as processing fees, annual fees, early repayment penalties and late payment charges.

Beyond that, it is important to consider the loan tenure, which is the amount of time you have to repay your loan. The duration is determined by several factors such as your income and age.

Often, those who are nearer to retirement will have a shorter loan tenure than, say, someone in their 20s.

“A shorter tenure typically means lower total interest but higher monthly repayments.

""The tip here is to pick the shortest tenure based on your monthly finances and not stretch yourself too thin,” Mr Mark Tan added.

When it comes to taking a loan to invest, theoretically, you could profit if the interest rate of your investment is higher than the cost of the loan, the experts said.

“As a general rule, only borrow what you can comfortably repay and invest amounts you can afford to lose,” Mr Mark Tan said.

“Although investment products may promise returns surpassing the interest on a loan, the unpredictability of markets poses substantial risks,” he warned.

It is important to conduct thorough research, consider potential losses and consult a licensed financial adviser before making such investments, he cautioned.

Mr Lawrence Tan said that taking a loan to invest doubles the risk.

“Normally, this is not encouraged unless the investor has sufficient buffers to repay the loan at any time should the leverage risk turn out to be unsustainable,” he cautioned.

“It’s not about 'appetite' or psychological tolerance for risk – it’s about having the means and capacity.”

It is especially not advisable when it comes to investing in the stock market or in speculative assets such as cryptocurrency, Ms Lye warned.

“Although stocks are assets, their value is not stable and can be volatile. To benefit from investing in stocks, you need to have the time horizon to ride through volatility,” she said.

“Borrowing means that you may not be able to do so and you can lose more than you invested.”

Even if the investment falls, loan repayments will still be due.

“When loan repayments are due, you may be pressured to sell and actualise your loss just to stay afloat.

""There could also be potential loss when the cost of the loan shoots up unexpectedly and exceeds the potential profit,” she further warned.

“In today’s uncertain macroeconomic environment, it is even less advisable to do so. It creates a lot of unnecessary stress, which can cause you to take desperate action with very bad consequences.”

As far as I can tell, most people will have to take a loan at some point in their life such as for housing. So how does one deal with it?

When it comes to repaying your debts, the experts said there are two schools of thought.

One is to pay the loan off in full quickly to reduce your liability.

The other, if you have spare money, is to invest it at a rate higher than your loan’s interest rate – allowing you to profit from this as you make your monthly repayments.

There are some things to consider before deciding if you should quickly pay off your loans. This includes early repayment fees and if the interest rates are higher than the potential investment outcomes if you want to invest.

Ms Lye said that when it comes to housing loans, they often feature lower interest rates. And because a property is a stable asset that often appreciates over time, it could be worth investing your savings or spare money that you have instead of quickly paying off your loan.

“But even if you do not invest, paying off a housing loan with cash early has a potential downside,” she added.

This is because cash and investments are more liquid than property, which is difficult to monetise.

“This loss of flexibility can become a constraint should you lose your job and cash becomes precious.”

However, repaying a loan quickly could provide peace of mind, as well as ensure that you don't incur late repayment fees if you forget to make your repayment.

Ultimately, the warning is clear. It is important to be prudent when taking up loans and it is always about having the money you can afford to spend – or lose.

If this is too late for you and your debt has become too overwhelming, with the unsecured outstanding balance exceeding 12 times your monthly salary, you may want to consider debt consolidation to combine your debts into a single repayment account.

This reduces the risk of incurring multiple late fees and interest fees since you can keep track and make repayments in a single account, Ms Lye suggested.

Mr Lawrence Tan said that there are free financial literacy courses online that people can take before deciding to take a loan, such as those provided by the Institute of Financial Learning.

Considering the risks involved, I probably would not take up a loan to invest in hopes of turning a higher return.

And when I eventually take a loan for my housing needs, I know now I shouldn't rush to quickly pay off the loan and if my savings allow, may explore some form of investment.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/today/adulting/loan-debt-invest-finance-adulting-5128491,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z
CNA,Your craving for sugar or caffeine and what it reveals of how you cope with stress,"It is 3pm on a weekday and the post-lunch slump hits hard. Right on cue, a colleague chimes in with the familiar refrain: “Anyone want bubble tea?”

No, I might initially protest, mostly out of a vague sense of health consciousness or guilt from the overpriced caffeinated drink I already bought that morning. Then, someone always coaxes: “It’s okay, just treat yourself.”

It rarely takes much convincing. I cave, like clockwork, and end up reaching for a chocolate waffle, a fizzy drink or maybe a tiny pack of chips to push through a particularly tedious task.

We tell ourselves it’s all right in moderation, that these little indulgences serve a purpose. After all, what is a little sugar or caffeine if it gives us the jolt we need to power through the day?

Yet, more often than not, I’ve reached the bottom of the cup or the last bite of a snack before I’ve even finished the task for which I needed that boost.

This begs the question: Is this “treat” truly helping? Or have we trained ourselves to believe that it does?

I turned to a dietitian and psychologists to find some answers.

When does a reward become a crutch? And are there better ways to lift our mood or productivity without needing to unwrap a snack or grab a cup of latte?

First, the positive news. The health experts said that going for the occasional snack does offer a real, physiological boost – at least in the short term – but it depends on the type and portion of the “treat”.

Ms Annabelle Johnson, an accredited dietitian in private practice here, said that consuming sugar can stimulate the brain’s “reward system”, leading to a release of dopamine and feeling of pleasure.

A moderate intake of beverages containing caffeine such as coffee and tea may also carry health benefits and lead to a productivity boost, she added.

For example, a cup of espresso might help someone who had a poor night’s sleep to focus better at work, though reaching for a third or fourth cup of coffee is likely to be excessive.

“Caffeine is a stimulant that works in the brain. It can increase alertness in many people, though the effect differs between individuals and the dose of caffeine,” Ms Johnson said.

However, she cautioned that excessive intakes of sugar can be associated with unstable blood sugar and in turn, unstable energy levels, while excessive caffeine intake can lead to anxiety, heart palpitations and insomnia.

Ms Ooi Sze Jin, founder and psychologist at mental health social enterprise A Kind Place, said that the benefits gained from snacking for an energy boost is “definitely not just placebo”.

The not-so-positive news is that our bodies may negatively adapt to the physical effects of relying on such snacks.

Ms Ooi pointed out that caffeine may block “sleepy signals” in one’s brain but also constricts blood vessels.

“With regular use, your brain adapts to this. When you don't have caffeine, those vessels dilate, which is a key reason for withdrawal headaches,” she added.

“So there are genuine physical effects, but the habit and expectation create a strong psychological pull that can feel like a need even when the physical boost isn't as strong.”

Indeed, beyond the physical effects that an afternoon cuppa provides, what often keeps the habit going is the psychological boost that these “treats” give, the health experts said.

Mr Muhammad Haikal Jamil, founder and senior clinical psychologist at ImPossible Psychological Services, said that turning to daily sweet treats usually performs “an emotional function instead of a physiological one”.

Eating confectionery may fulfil an emotional need to feel rewarded and satisfied. It can also be a way to self-soothe during periods of stress, providing a temporary emotional lift, he added.

“Even though we may be feeling stressed, treating ourselves provides us with a sense of control in our ability to improve our mood. Enjoying the sweet treat also provides a window for us to take a break away from the stressors faced.”

Ms Ooi the psychologist said that a sugary snack or caffeinated drink can be a learned shortcut to cope, but the person would not learn how to process stress and manage one’s emotions in healthier ways.

“A healthy treat is a conscious, occasional reward or pleasure. A crutch is used to escape or numb feelings, often leading to guilt later and preventing you from building better coping skills.”

Though snacking may not be a greater cause for concern compared to other coping strategies for stress such as substance abuse, Mr Haikal emphasised the importance of moderating any coping strategy that one adopts, even beneficial ones such as exercising.

“Over-reliance on a certain coping strategy usually occurs as a result of our attempt to escape an overwhelming stressor. However, we are not addressing the issue or developing our ability to overcome them,” he added.

In my example, therefore, if I keep ""treating"" myself during a slump, it can become a psychological crutch when consuming sweet treats crosses the threshold into “emotional eating”, where I am simply trying to “eat away” negative emotions to suppress feelings about work and deadlines.

A key sign to watch for is difficulty stopping once you start or you feel compulsive cravings for sweets in response to stress, Mr Haikal said.

Though snacking wisely can help one feel satisfied while keeping energy levels up, Ms Johnson the dietitian said that one would be better off taking the right amounts of carbohydrates, fat and protein in meals because these can support stabler energy levels.

She also pointed out that reliance on quick fixes such as a sugary snack or a dose of caffeine might be masking the primary source of one’s low energy such as sleep deprivation.

“Our energy levels are affected by a myriad of factors from a lack of a balanced diet, poor sleep, chronic stress or chronic health conditions. Thus, it is important to take a step back and consider the root cause of how we are feeling,” Ms Johnson said.

A desire to snack by taking more sugar or caffeine could be coming from yet-to-be-uncovered chronic health conditions such as nutritional deficiencies, insomnia and diabetes, she added.

Besides, drinking too much caffeine could be dangerous for anyone, not least those who may have prevailing health issues such as kidney or heart problems, Ms Johnson cautioned.

She proposed picking up good habits that can support an energy slump. Apart from having a balanced snack, work towards staying hydrated and going for a walk instead.

Mr Haikal said that it would not be enough to try and eliminate your reliance on sweet treats or caffeine since that may leave you feeling unfulfilled.

You must know why it is unhealthy in the long run and accept it in the first place.

You may also have to learn that there are other ways to handle a problem (stress) instead of choosing a quick fix (unhealthy snack) all the time. This means, for example, developing a mindset of understanding that you do not have to get rid of negative emotions immediately.

You have to want to make active choices towards healthier alternatives based on your interests and preferences.

Turning to unhealthy snacks to cope with tough emotions may reinforce one’s tendency to avoid problems and may weaken resilience or one’s natural ability to bounce back from stress, Ms Ooi said.

Instead, you may consider turning to non-consumption rewards such as stepping away from work for a quick walk or chatting with a colleague. These can be much more effective in the long term because they can train the brain to associate rewards with healthier activities.

“Awareness is key. Start by observing when and why you crave them without judgment. Then, make tiny changes. Reduce the amount gradually such as opting for less sugar or a smaller coffee cup,” Ms Ooi suggested.

While I personally make no promises to give up the occasional afternoon snack, working on this article has been a useful exercise in reflection.

The red velvet latte I bought to motivate myself – rich with chocolate and good intentions – was scarfed down before I’d written a single word.

What did help, in the end, was the promise of having some company from my colleague for the journey home, if I met my self-imposed deadline.

CNA,Lawyer’s push for change in justice system gets MinLaw support for those with invisible needs,"*Names have been changed.

SINGAPORE: It was an evening when his father was working from home and could not pause to spend time with him. Frustrated, 19-year-old *James had a meltdown that escalated into aggression.

His father called the police for assistance. When officers arrived, however, James was so distressed that he hurled the nearest object, a stool, at them. As they pinned him down, he apologised repeatedly but was too agitated to follow instructions.

No charges were filed against James, who had special needs. In a letter to the Singapore Police Force, his pro bono lawyers explained that he had been diagnosed with intellectual disability, psychosis, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and sensory processing disorder.



“There was no intention to cause harm or (obstruct) the police. … What (he) requires is continued support and medical intervention,” the letter stated, adding that James had been undergoing rehabilitative programmes with his family’s support to manage his impulses.

For veteran lawyer Peggy Yee, cases like James’ — which she handled in 2021 — are all too familiar.

About a third of her work is done pro bono or at a charitable discount, and most of those cases involve people with invisible disabilities, such as mental health issues, neurodivergent conditions and chronic illnesses.

“There’s no sign on their forehead that says, ‘I have this condition.’ But that person is debilitated by that condition,” she said.

Many offenders with mental disorders or special needs may struggle to regulate their emotions and impulses or fully grasp the consequences of their words and actions, which could have caused their run-ins with the law.

Unlike James, many of them are taken to court, and Yee is pushing for a fairer, more inclusive criminal justice system in Singapore — one with better management, treatment and sentencing frameworks for persons with invisible disabilities.

To this end, she hopes a multi-agency task force comprising ministries and social support agencies can be established.

It would be an “ideal collaborative system” and would “identify gaps in capability for each agency”, she said yesterday in the inaugural Access to Justice Symposium, which brought together legal practitioners, policymakers and mental health professionals.

Guest of honour and Second Minister for Law Edwin Tong, who took to the podium after Yee’s speech at the State Courts, said the Ministry of Law (MinLaw) is committed to such a task force.

The symposium, hosted by legal aid charity Pro Bono SG, was co-organised by Yee, whose call to action was the latest step in her mission to speak up for those who cannot defend themselves in the fight for justice.

That mission and her personal story are also told in CNA series Extraordinary People, which celebrates everyday heroes in Singapore who have dedicated their lives to uplifting at-risk groups while often overcoming personal challenges along the way.

One case Yee highlighted as demonstrative of gaps in the law involved a teenager with an intelligence quotient of 61 who was charged with rape and sexual assault.

His lawyer — communicating with him using dolls — found that he was unable to articulate what he had done; nor did he understand issues of consent. Still, psychiatrists deemed him fit to plead in court.

In sentencing the youth to reformative training instead of imprisonment and caning, Justice Woo Bih Li wrote that the sentencing options in Singapore were “so limited” for youth offenders who have an intellectual disability but are not of unsound mind.

Seven years on, there remains this need for more sentencing options — in particular, one that is more severe than probation and more apt than reformative training — cited Yee.

According to a research note prepared for the symposium, minimum sentences for certain offences make no concession for those with invisible disabilities, and many invisible disabilities are not provided for adequately in the Penal Code and the Criminal Procedure Code.

A reduction in prison time is usually the only recourse an offender has, if the mitigation plea is successful, stated the research note.

It makes Yee wonder whether prison is “the final repository where all offenders with untreatable mental conditions will end up”.

The prison environment can worsen the mental state of those with invisible disabilities, which can lead to consequences including self-harm and suicidal tendencies. “There must be more options so that a better way can be found,” she told CNA Insider.

That said, there is something she wants to make clear about her advocacy for those with invisible disabilities.

“I’m not advocating or saying for one moment that just because the offender has special needs or a mental illness,” she stressed, “that’s a free pass to … go on a crime spree.”

She added, however, that different agencies have their own provisions for those with invisible disabilities — not only offenders, but also victims and witnesses — which may not only leave gaps, but also barriers to justice.

“How do (these persons) advocate for themselves when they struggle to process information? How do they exercise their rights when they’re unable to (express) themselves?” she asked. “How can they prevent the actions and words from being misunderstood?

“Who or which agency is to manage these persons?”

Most of Yee’s pro bono cases involving clients with invisible disabilities are obtained through referrals from Pro Bono SG. And its chief executive officer, Tanguy Lim, called her the “go-to person for … complex cases involving special needs”.

Lim cited her passion for helping them and her effectiveness in working with not only them but also their families and social workers.

Beyond criminal cases, she helps individuals who struggle to advocate for themselves in civil disputes.

One such person was Ivan Wong, a final-year polytechnic student. Following a dispute with the company he was interning at, he was unable to complete his internship. This affected his graduation prospects.

Stress started to take its toll on Wong, who had been recovering from leukaemia. A friend brought his case to the attention of Arc Children’s Centre — a charity supporting children with cancer — which reached out to Yee in turn.

“Ivan is what I’d call a vulnerable client, … not being in the best of health and at risk of a cancer relapse,” said Yee, the founding director of law firm PY Legal.

She also described him as “a very mild, timid person” who would typically take “anything that isn’t legally right” on the chin.

With her help, however, the company paid him for the period he worked there. And his polytechnic arranged a fresh internship, allowing him to fulfil his graduation requirements.

“She understood my issues and was willing to fully resolve (them) so that I could have ease of mind,” Wong said gratefully.

Yee also personally understands the challenge of battling cancer. She was diagnosed with Stage 2 cancer in 2021.

“How could I have cancer?” was her disbelieving reaction. “I’m … running four times a week. I don’t drink, I don’t smoke, I don’t even drink coffee or tea.”

Her doctor urged her to undergo surgery to remove the fast-growing cancerous mass shown on her scans, followed by chemotherapy. “I just did what I had to,” she said. “It wasn’t an easy time.”

Yet, her commitment to justice remained relentless. She negotiated with her doctor to postpone her surgery for five days — just enough time to wrap up a case involving a client with schizophrenia who was facing multiple charges of theft.

Schizophrenia is a mental disorder that affects a person’s understanding of what is real and what is imaginary.

In her mitigation plea, Yee argued that her client, *Anna, had committed the offences as a maladaptive way of coping with her low mood and auditory hallucinations, among other struggles she faced related to her mental health issues.

Under section 379 of the Penal Code, she could have been jailed for up to three years, fined or both. Thanks to Yee’s advocacy, Anna was sentenced to a 24-month mandatory treatment order instead and underwent psychiatric treatment as required.

Yee, meanwhile, had surgery and is not only cancer-free now, with “a new lease of life”, but free to pursue her advocacy for people with invisible needs, who “deserve to be heard and … understood”.

“Cancer won’t stop me,” she said. “I refuse to give it that credit.”

Even though her pro bono cases can be stressful, “because sometimes there’s no good outcome, no matter how hard you try”, the emotional toll does not hold back the lawyer who was called to the Bar in 1987.

“I’ll lose sleep over it,” she shared. “My family knows, and they’ll be my comforters, and they’ll remind me, ‘Hey, you know there’s only so much you can do.’”

Ultimately, she feels a “huge sense of responsibility” for each case she takes on, she said. “Because (with) every case, there’s someone’s life story in there. It’s not just four numbers on a file.”

CNA,When upholding sovereignty is a balancing act: Here are 4 ways city-states like Singapore do it,"SINGAPORE: Lorries from construction sites all over Singapore are going to one of the easternmost points of the country, in Changi, every day.

There, where land meets water, they form lines delivering valuable material: sand and soil. Barges are waiting to be loaded and then carry the volumes of earth to Pulau Tekong, the site of busy land reclamation works.

The island, a training area for Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) soldiers and combat vehicles, is being expanded to meet those needs.

It is not the first such project at Pulau Tekong. With its proximity to Johor, there was a land reclamation case between Singapore and Malaysia heard by the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea in the early 2000s.



That case was resolved with both countries agreeing on slight modifications to the Tekong reclamation then and agreeing to monitor the area’s ecology, with Singapore also compensating Malaysian fishermen and paying for some protection works across the Johor Strait.

Singapore, whose land area has expanded significantly over the past 200 years, is also not the only country where land reclamation has played a crucial role in development.

For centuries, city-states in particular have pushed the boundaries of their limited land by advancing into the sea. But there are sensitivities, trade-offs and a balance to be struck.

“Land reclamation has been a challenging diplomatic issue because it’s not something any country can do unilaterally,” noted Bilahari Kausikan, the former Permanent Secretary of Singapore’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

“It has a huge transboundary effect, which has to be taken seriously. And it has to be discussed between countries.

“Before you do any land reclamation, you have to do an environmental impact study to make sure it doesn’t have undue deleterious effects on your neighbours.”

Centuries ago, the city-state Venice was built on reclaimed land. Venetians drove timber piles into soft marshland, creating a stable foundation. Planks and limestone were laid on top, forming the base for much of Venice.

“They had no choice. All the other countries were enemies. They needed the protection of water around the city,” said researcher Luca Zaggia at the Italian National Research Council’s Institute of Geosciences and Earth Resources.

“That’s where they became really ingenious because they found a wonderful way of building foundations in such places.”

In this way, Venice grew from a settlement that was 1 sq km to a city more than seven times its original size. It was an island republic that lasted for over 1,000 years.

Today, only three city-states remain: Singapore, Monaco and Vatican City — all small, vulnerable and resource-scarce. Their existence is a perpetual balancing act, but that is also what drives them to greatness.

The series, Singapore’s Balancing Act, explores the challenges faced by city-states, their strategies for success and how they can endure. Here are four ways in which they safeguard their sovereignty — sometimes similarly, sometimes differently.

The smallest of the city-states, and the smallest nation on earth, is Vatican City, located within Italy’s capital, Rome.

While the Vatican has public spaces, with its ancient walls standing as its first line of defence, access to its inner sanctum is protected by the Swiss Guards.

Often called “the world’s smallest army”, they have protected popes for over 500 years. Their duties range from the daily protection of the pontiff to managing security during major events and papal audiences.

They must be Catholic Swiss citizens, at least 1.74m tall, must have done military service in Switzerland and must have graduated from high school at a minimum, before they can swear allegiance to the Vatican.

“We’re very proud about it,” said Swiss Guard spokesman Corporal Eliah Cinotti. “For me, it’s special because we have it — this citizenship — only (while) we’re here in the Vatican. When we go back, we have to give back the citizenship.”

With 135 members, the Swiss Guard is not a full-fledged military.

The situation is somewhat similar in Monaco, which has just over 120 soldiers. Their primary duties include ensuring the security of their prince and guarding the principality’s palace. For its military defence, Monaco relies on France.

Singapore, meanwhile, depends primarily on its own citizens for its defence and boasts a technologically advanced air force, navy, army and digital and intelligence services.

Military defence is consistently one of the largest items in Singapore’s Budget, with expenditure projected to be S$23.4 billion (US$17.6 billion) in the coming financial year. The city-state ranks among Asia’s top 10 defence spenders and leads in Southeast Asia.

“We don’t live in the most salubrious neighbourhood. Our neighbours don’t love us dearly. They’re polite to us. Why? Because we have a strong defence,” said Kausikan.

“Therefore, you have to spend some amount of your money on defence, even as we’ll need to increase social spending due to an ageing population.”

Acquisition of high-tech equipment has gone hand in hand with skills improvement in the SAF. After decades of operating second-hand submarines, for example, the Republic of Singapore Navy has introduced its state-of-the-art Invincible-class submarines, manned by highly trained crews.

The first two submarines were commissioned in September — the same month that Singapore’s first fully digitalised armoured fighting vehicle, the Hunter, debuted in Exercise Wallaby in Australia. The annual exercise is the SAF’s largest unilateral overseas exercise.

For city-states throughout history, diplomacy has also been key to survival and advancing national interests. Venice, for example, had an extensive network of diplomats.

“Venetians were ready to be sent into the world. They knew languages. They were curious. And they travelled all around the Mediterranean area, northern Europe, Africa … and the Far East,” said author Alberto Toso Fei, an expert in Venice’s history.

“More than this, … they decided to found the diplomatic post — everywhere. This is a Venetian invention.”

In 1965, when Singapore became independent, it also swiftly established its first diplomatic missions: in Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta and New York City. Today, the city-state maintains over 50 overseas missions.

“If you’re a small city-state, it’s very important for you to know what’s going on in the world,” said Kausikan.

“Singapore will never be an island. What I mean is that you can’t insulate yourself. … You can take advantage of opportunities or get out of harm’s way in good time. But you can’t do (either) without a diplomatic network.”

Vatican City has an extensive diplomatic network too.

The Holy See, the governing body of the Catholic Church, has relations with 184 states, which is “fundamental to the very identity of the papacy”, said Archbishop Paul Richard Gallagher, the Vatican secretary for relations with states.

“Popes over the centuries have always had relations with kings and presidents and other rulers.”

Visits like Pope Francis’ Asia-Pacific trip last year are a “very important” way of complementing those diplomatic strategies.

“Any official visit, whether it’s by a pope or by a president or a king, is … one of the instruments that you use in maintaining a relationship, deepening a relationship,” said Gallagher.

“It also gives you an opportunity to (convey a) message to a people, to the local church and to leaders.”

And through the global influence of the Catholic Church, the Vatican’s diplomatic reach is not hindered by Italy. There are 90 diplomatic missions to the Holy See in the heart of Rome.

In contrast, Monaco has had its diplomacy limited by its dependence on France. After World War I, the coastal city-state signed a treaty with its larger neighbour that traded some diplomatic independence for military protection.

As a result, its foreign policy had to be “perfectly aligned with France’s interests in international foreign affairs”, said Jean-Marie Veran, special adviser to Monaco’s minister of foreign affairs and cooperation.

Monaco had to reach prior agreement with France on any action the principality wished to take, he said. But the two states signed a new treaty in 2002 that has changed that.

The city-state has since been able to have, for example, ambassadors from foreign countries accredited to its prince.

For Singapore, meanwhile, diplomatic autonomy is underpinned by its ability to defend itself. And through collaboration with a range of defence partners, both its defence and diplomacy are enhanced.

“There’s such a thing as defence diplomacy. Anybody that wants to work with us in defence, we’ll work (with), provided it’s in our interest,” said Kausikan.

“Our closest defence partner is the US, and its allies, … because our interests are aligned, and they’re better than us. If (we) want to improve our defence, we have to work with them.”

But autonomy is also tested by a lack of vital resources, and city-states have had to negotiate dependence on larger neighbours for food and water.

Vatican City gets all of its water from Rome. And in 2017, the city-state turned off all its fountains, including those in its iconic St Peter’s Square, because of a drought affecting Rome.

The Vatican also buys its electricity from Italy, so it is “very aware of that dependence and that relationship”, said Gallagher.

“But it’s not a bad thing to recognise one’s dependence. If we want to be totally, totally independent, if we have a notion of sovereignty that’s like that, then it’s not really being realistic.”

In Singapore, whose population crossed the six million mark last year, demand for food is growing.

It imports more than 90 per cent of its food and has set itself the goal of producing 30 per cent of its nutritional needs by 2030 — with only about 1 per cent of land set aside for agriculture.

Singapore is not reliant on any single source of food, however, as its imports come from over 180 countries and regions.

“We’re a global city where our hinterland is no longer Malaya or Malaysia; it’s the world,” said Kausikan. “But what was left was water.”

Under the 1962 Water Agreement, Singapore is entitled to draw up to 250 million gallons of water per day from Johor, priced at 3 Malaysian sen per thousand gallons. This is more than half of the city-state’s current water demand.

The 99-year agreement has been a cornerstone of Singapore’s water supply but also an occasional source of tension with Malaysia.

“You can’t change international agreements unilaterally. To put it in Singlish, cannot ‘suka-suka’ change just because you don’t like it,” said Kausikan. “It’s a challenge to our sovereignty because water is (a matter of) life and death.”

Importing water was a challenge for Venice too, as its rival powers controlled the water sources on the surrounding mainland. “Getting water from the mainland would’ve been dangerous for the risk of attacks or poisoning,” said Zaggia.

To bring about a self-sufficient water supply, Venetians designed rooftops and open squares in a way that funnelled rainwater into an underground filtration system made of sand and stone. The filtered water was collected in large cisterns, or wells.

This is similar to the way Singapore uses more than two-thirds of its land surface as a catchment area for its reservoirs.

Over in Monaco, six spring water sources can provide 30 to 50 per cent of the city-state’s water supply. But these local water sources are under threat, and one reason is climate change.

“The situation used to be very comfortable. We had many resources … in France, in Monaco. And today, it’s over,” said Manuel Nardi, chief executive officer of Societe Monegasque des Eaux (Monegasque Water Company).

“We must be very careful with water and search for new resources and alternative resources.”

Nardi thinks there will be “no choice” but to move towards recycling used water — as Singapore has done with NEWater — because Monaco’s wastewater treatment plant has “the most capacity” to supply water.

For Singapore, reclaimed water can meet up to 40 per cent of its water needs — with the construction of another treatment facility, the Tuas Water Reclamation Plant, already under way.

After decades of investment, the city-state has become a global leader in water reclamation. NEWater, local catchment water, imported water from Malaysia and desalinated water have become the four national taps.

“Without that existential threat of having our water supply dry up, we wouldn’t have invested in NEWater. We may not have thought about recycling our wastewater, but we did,” said Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy senior lecturer Woo Jun Jie.

“For a city-state that’s been backed into a corner frequently, innovation has been key. And that’s allowed us to survive.”

While scarcity of another resource — land — is something Singapore has had to address owing to urban and population growth, the city-state is reclaiming land to mitigate the impacts of rising sea levels as well.

Take the Long Island reclamation project, which aims to create about 800 hectares of land off the East Coast as part of Singapore’s coastal defence.

It will protect against sea-level rise, enhance flood resilience, create a new reservoir for water security and provide space for future development needs.

Other measures could include coastal barriers as well as tidal gates and pumping stations, like at the Marina Barrage, said Hazel Khoo, the director of coastal protection at national water agency PUB.

WATCH PART 2: How global city-states balance economic growth and liveability (47:19)

But the new project comes with a few concerns and trade-offs, as land reclamation will affect the environment and disrupt sea sports.

“I believe we have to work together with the government to make sure that this Long Island project doesn’t hinder outdoor sea activities,” said windsurfing coach and former national sailor Chua Tan Ching.

Khoo sees it as an opportunity to introduce new recreational and water activities.

There will be conversations with members of the public, businesses and sporting associations, she promised, “as to what they’d want to see in terms of activating the spaces within Long Island”.

In modern-day Venice, a mega project to shield the city from rising waters, while permitting the flow of ships in and out of the Venetian Lagoon, has already been designed.

The MOSE system, in use since 2020, consists of 78 steel gates that normally lie flat underwater but are raised using compressed air when extreme high tides are forecast, forming a flood barrier at the lagoon’s three inlet channels.

This feat of modern engineering, costing about 6 billion euros (US$6.5 billion), is a “strategic infrastructure” that will last 100 years, said Giovanni Zarotti, the technical director behind the project.

Before this, there was the Murazzi, stone walls stretching for 16km along Venice’s barrier islands and standing close to 5 metres above sea level.

But during a storm surge in 2019, Venice suffered its worst flood in over 50 years. Those sea walls — up to 280 years old — have since been reinforced, while a beach nourishment programme was also implemented for greater coastal protection.

While the Murazzi and the Long Island plan are separated by centuries and a vast distance, Kelly Latimer, the host of Singapore’s Balancing Act, thinks lessons can be learned from Venice.

For one thing, Venetians have built a life near the sea walls, “including large green spaces, recreational spaces as well”, she observed.

“This is something we can look to for Long Island, a potential future for us where we can live, work and play.”

CNA,Why Hong Kong's Gen Z is ditching full-time work,"HONG KONG: When Alex Wong was growing up, his father spent most of his time at work instead of at home. Family holidays were also limited to summertime.

But his father made a promise: After retirement, they would surely make up for lost time.

That promise was shattered when, shortly after Wong’s 18th birthday, his father suffered a spinal injury that left him paralysed.

It was a life-changing moment for Wong. If his father had worked tirelessly for a future that never came, he thought, what was stopping the same from happening to him?



“Previously I’d spent most of my time studying,” the 22-year-old said. “Now I want to enjoy myself enough first and think about the future only in my 30s.”

His commitment to this altered path is unwavering, even in the face of financial hardship. His mother, the family breadwinner, supports not only his father, but also his six-year-old brother. They also had to hire a domestic helper from Indonesia.

Wong copes by taking on warehouse jobs a few days a month, earning just HK$310 (US$40) a day when there is work to be found. But he is not in any rush to secure something more stable.

His mindset is far from unique. A Hong Kong government-related survey last year found that among youth (aged 15 to 29) not studying or working, 36 per cent had no plans to get a job.

Indeed, the phenomenon called “tang ping”, or lying flat — a rejection of the culture of hard work — has gained ground in the city.

WATCH: Gen Zers are rethinking 9-to-5 work — Will Hong Kong cope without the hustle? (43:56)

About 44 per cent of secondary students in a Hong Kong Young Women’s Christian Association poll last year said they were lying flat or planning to do so.

For some, it is about freedom. For others, it is boredom.

Ken Hui, 26, worked full-time for about six months before quitting in 2023. His admin job, tied to sports and event planning, seemed exciting at first but quickly became repetitive.

“I don’t want to go back to full-time (work) because I don’t want my job to be very monotonous — repeating the same work every day (and) knocking off at the same time,” he said. “There’s no life.”

He now gets by with freelance gigs, like photography.

Some Gen Z professionals, meanwhile, are freelancing full-time or juggling multiple part-time jobs. They are a growing group known as “slashers” — so named because of the slashes in their job descriptions.

Make-up artist Joyce Fung, for instance, is also a part-time bagel maker at a cafe. “I’m lucky that the cafe is flexible about working hours,” the 25-year-old said. “They know that I’m a ‘slasher’ and I take on freelance work.

“After I finish my make-up work or on days with no make-up jobs, I can work there.”

She does not plan on stopping, perhaps ever. “I’m very scared of boredom,” Fung said. “If I must … work 9 to 5 every day and do work that’s pretty much the same, that isn’t a way of life I desire.”

As young Hongkongers like her eschew stable careers, the programme Insight explores whether the city’s Gen Z are growing work-weary altogether and what can move the needle for them.

In 2022, government data showed that Hong Kong had lost around 116,600 young workers (aged 18 to 39) over a two-year period. Many either left the city or simply opted out of the workforce.

Experts posit that one reason behind the shift in Gen Z is the financial security achieved by previous generations.

“(Their) parents are … better off and don’t expect the new generation to earn a lot to take care of them,” said Benson Chan, chief officer of the Mental Health Association of Hong Kong. “This generation doesn’t really face financial pressures.”

As a result, many young adults remain financially dependent on their families, with a majority still living at home.

This has given rise to the buzzword “full-time children”, young adults who live with their parents and help out with household chores in exchange for an allowance.

Beyond their parents’ purse strings, many Gen Zers are also focused on the present rather than on long-term financial goals.

Most of Wong’s friends, he said, have a spend-now, work-later mentality. They would rather earn just enough to buy games, upgrade their devices and enjoy life. “They think about going back to work only when they run out of money.”

Chan suggested that growing up in a world of social media and instant gratification has left Gen Zers feeling unfulfilled when their wants are not met immediately.

At the same time, long-term financial goals seem out of reach. A 2024 HSBC survey found that 61 per cent of Gen Z Hongkongers believed home ownership was “far-fetched” for them.

After all, Hong Kong is one of the world’s most expensive property markets: The average private home costs US$1.15 million.

It does not seem worth it for Hui. “I don’t want to put my money in property and cars,” he said. “I work so that I can earn money to go travelling.”

Chan believes this disillusionment runs deeper. “Many youths feel, ‘If I can’t meet expectations anyway, why should I work?’” he said.

The pandemic also helped shape Gen Z’s perspectives. It cut off their social interactions and deepened feelings of seclusion.

Wong experienced this firsthand. While studying in mainland China as a cross-border student, he found himself trapped under strict quarantine measures.

“In the small neighbourhoods, you were all boarded up, with only one point of entry and exit. You could only use delivery services to get groceries,” recalled Wong, who became “even more reclusive”.

The isolation, combined with exam stress, took a toll on his mental health. At his lowest point, he even considered taking his own life.

Chan, who works with young people experiencing mental health issues, said many of them struggle because “they face outside pressures or lack a clear goal for their future”.

Despite their reluctance to work full-time, Gen Zers might not have the luxury to hold off on seeking permanent employment as opportunities are dwindling.

Take 24-year-old Ada Siu. A recent communications graduate, she and some of her classmates struggled for six months to land a full-time job. They had to submit over 100 applications each to secure a few interviews.

Hong Kong’s post-pandemic recovery has been sluggish. Gross domestic product growth last year — 2.5 per cent — was at the lowest point of the projected range. This year, growth is expected to be between 2 per cent and 3 per cent.

Small and medium enterprises have been hardest hit. High interest rates, a property slump and an exodus of investors have left these businesses struggling to stay afloat.

They make up more than 98 per cent of Hong Kong’s total enterprises, employ more than 44 per cent of the private sector workforce but must scramble to attract young talent.

A few months ago, Siu secured a full-time role at a small agency, where she helped with events and public relations. But her time there did not last long.

“On the fourth day, … I already felt (the company) was unsuitable for me,” she recalled. “I went right back to job hunting. … I left after a month.”

Two in five Gen Zers and millennials in Hong Kong often think about leaving their jobs, according to a survey last year. Many of them may be in search of greater engagement.

“I’d feel like a frog … in boiling water,” Siu said about staying long in a company. “If I feel that I’ve already learnt enough in this position or have experienced enough, then I think it’s natural to want to change.”

Job hopping is frowned upon, however, in Hong Kong’s traditional work culture.

“(Job hoppers) are … seen as a high cost for companies because you train them and then they leave,” noted Wendy Suen, the head of talent solutions for recruitment consultancy ConnectedConsult.

Adding to the challenge for Hong Kong’s Gen Z is competition from mainland China. Since 2022, relaxed visa rules have allowed more mainlanders to live and work in the city.

In 2023, there was an upsurge in applications for the Immigration Arrangements for Non-local Graduates visa, which allows non-local students to stay in Hong Kong and work after graduation, cited Natixis Corporate and Investment Banking senior economist Gary Ng.

And since November, the government has also allowed non-local undergraduates to work part-time. This applies to around 20,000 students, equivalent to more than 3 per cent of the 15 to 24 age group in Hong Kong.

That is an influx of job hunters into a labour market that is not growing, observed Ng.

“If (non-local students) want to stay in Hong Kong, … it’d be fair to assume that some of (them) may be willing to work harder to basically compete for the same jobs,” he said.

Suen added that mainlanders are increasingly drawn to Hong Kong as a stepping stone to the global arena and tend to be more receptive to traditional work expectations such as long hours.

To attract more Gen Z Hongkongers, who are increasingly concerned about burnout, anxiety and mental health, Suen suggested that companies should focus on implementing well-being initiatives.

A survey released last year by mental health startup Intellect and digital wealth platform Endowus found that 31 per cent of Hong Kong millennials and Gen Zers wanted their workplaces to offer mental wellness workshops.

In another recent survey, global communications firm Edelman found that Hong Kong’s Gen Z have high expectations for their leaders. They want a manager who is hard-working and someone like a friend, whom they can connect with naturally.

Young workers are also known to seek out flatter hierarchies and more collaborative work environments. Many of these preferences, however, could prove challenging in Hong Kong’s workplaces, which remain largely hierarchical, with an emphasis on rules and professionalism.

Then there is the city’s long-hours culture. According to a Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions survey in 2023, more than half of workers put in over 45 hours a week; 7.3 per cent of respondents worked over 70 hours.

Gen Zers want flexibility. Nearly eight in 10 Gen Z workers in Hong Kong prefer hybrid working, and a lack thereof was the main reason three in 10 workers left previous jobs, according to global workspace provider International Working Group.

The average Gen Z employee wants to “work smart, not hard”, yet is someone who thrives on challenges and craves stimulation and opportunities to learn, described Suen.

“(Gen Zers) value time,” she said. “They know what they want, and they ask for it, and they don’t want to waste anybody’s time as well.”

CNA,"Mother, doctor, ex-inmates: Meet some unsung heroes in CNA series Extraordinary People","SINGAPORE: It was 2012 when Steven Goh, a financial adviser then, was waiting for a client at a Housing Board void deck, and from nowhere an elderly woman approached him.

“Eh, boy … can you come to my house to take a look? I need your help,” he recalled her telling him.

Initially, he thought it was a ploy to get money. But when he stepped inside her flat, he found it filled wall-to-wall with metal junk, much like a “karang guni’s” storeroom. All she wanted was help with clearing it out.

So he posted a call for volunteers on Facebook, and a group soon rallied to the cause.



“(Decluttering her home) was even more tiring than a normal workout in a gym,” Goh recollected. “But … that sincere ‘thank you’ from her (was something) I never got before.”

That moment lit the spark for Helping Joy, founded by Goh as a volunteer group dedicated to decluttering for the elderly.

Week after week, the team have rolled up their sleeves and sorted through belongings — restoring order and, in most cases, dignity. “When (the beneficiaries) see a very clean house, it makes them feel normal again,” said the 46-year-old.

Today, Helping Joy is a charity with more than 300 volunteers and takes referrals from social workers, senior centres, hospitals, Members of Parliament and the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF).

Beyond cleaning, its volunteers befriend elderly residents, provide free meals and even make “final journey arrangements” for some.

Around the same time Helping Joy was taking off, Alaric Tan was grappling with drug addiction. In February 2016, he was arrested and sent to the Drug Rehabilitation Centre for six months.

While that period of abstinence helped him realise recovery was possible, the turning point came when he hosted a recovery meeting despite having relapsed. “I was paranoid,” the 46-year-old recalled. “I was feeling very ashamed of myself.”

To his surprise, the participants reassured him that they believed he wanted to quit, that he was a good person and that he could break his 20-year addiction.

“I felt so safe and happy for the first time in my life that I just never had the craving to use drugs again,” said Tan, fighting back tears.

That was in 2017, on Jul 7, which became the official opening date of The Greenhouse, a recovery centre he founded in the following year.

It offers free and anonymous counselling, and its 12-step programme encourages clients to understand the cycle of addiction, with relapses regarded as part of the recovery process.

“To come to our centre and receive care for free from strangers shows you that the world isn’t what you think it is,” Tan said.

The Greenhouse has assisted over 400 clients in the past six years and runs a counselling training programme that has even benefitted professionals from the MSF.

Goh and Tan are just two of the many figures in the CNA series, Extraordinary People, which honours unsung heroes who go the extra mile to uplift communities in need. Here are three inspiring storylines not to be missed.

Over the past 13 years, Helping Joy has transformed around 400 homes. It provides support to more than 800 elderly individuals across Singapore and relies wholly on donations to keep going.

Refurbishing a home typically costs between S$3,000 and S$5,000. At times when money is short, however, Goh and his crew will either repurpose second-hand furniture from their centre or dip into their own pockets.

In the lean periods, Goh sometimes wonders, “Am I very stupid to be doing this? Is it a waste of time?”

But he is always reminded of the true value of his work. “Money is important, but it’s not everything,” he said. “The genuine support and the kindness people are giving … we can’t buy with money.”

Caregivers Alliance Limited (CAL) is another non-profit organisation devoted to a community that often goes unnoticed: carers of individuals with mental health issues.

CAL programme manager, Faiza Sanip, 55, began volunteering for the organisation during the pandemic — having started her own caregiving journey in 2014 when her second son, then 18, was diagnosed with schizophrenia.

“When we started seeing the symptoms, I was in denial,” she said. “He had this blank look on his face, and he was totally not functioning.

“He looked like he was lost within himself. And I felt like I’d lost my son.”

Faiza felt that way for years, not fully understanding the illness and not knowing where to turn for help as such mental illnesses were not talked about openly.

She felt as many other carers have felt — alone, with no one who could understand what they were experiencing. Then in 2020, she found an online course in English for carers. It was the lifeline she had been looking for.

When a programme manager approached her later about an opening for a full-time position at CAL, she knew it was her calling.

“At that time, we didn’t have programmes in Malay that talked openly about mental health issues … for caregivers of persons with mental health issues,” she said.

Besides leading CAL’s caregivers-to-caregivers training programmes, she introduced its first Malay-language course and is dedicated to raising mental health awareness in the Malay/Muslim community.

For some individuals, using past pain to heal and help others is the common thread in their lives. Tan, for example, sees himself as a wounded healer — someone who converts one’s past struggles into support for others.

With help from volunteers, The Greenhouse has seen a success rate of up to 80 per cent for drug use recovery and abstinence, he said.

The centre was also an early adopter of trauma-informed care, which focuses on asking, “What happened to you?” rather than “What’s wrong with you?”

“That then eliminates a lot of the shame that they feel,” said centre manager Shila Naidu, “because then they know that ‘I didn’t actively choose to do this harm to myself’.

“With that knowledge, with new coping tools introduced, with a loving community around them, they can then make better decisions for their future.”

Gopal Mahey, 42, is on a similar path. He leads group workshops thrice weekly for inmates in different clusters within Changi Prison. “We’re helping these individuals to become their own counsellors,” he said.

His journey as a wounded healer began when he was arrested in 2013 — and later charged with drug consumption and with possession of drugs for trafficking — despite being a counsellor working with inmates at the time.

“Talk about imposter syndrome,” he said wryly. “I’d go into the prison system, (while) actively using (drugs), and I’d speak about addiction.

“I’d have residents come up to me and say, ‘Mr Gopal, how come you know so much?’”

His incarceration had a profound impact on his family, including his counsellor mother and his wife — they had married 11 months before his arrest.

He missed pivotal moments, such as the deaths of his grandparents and the chance to bond with his newborn son.

After his release, he turned the page. He now works as a senior counsellor at the Centre for Psychotherapy and offers pro bono support to clients including those awaiting sentencing and neurodivergent offenders.

“I don’t just do this work because I enjoy it and it gives me … purpose,” he said. “I’m part of this population, and I can also love these people.”

Teoh Chin Sim, 60, has been working with another community. As Singapore’s first female sports and exercise medicine specialist, she has attended to the nation’s elite athletes for over 30 years.

At the 2012 London Paralympics, serving as Team Singapore’s chief medical officer, she witnessed something truly moving: After a Paralympic swimmer finished about two laps behind the others, the crowd gave a standing ovation, cheering louder than for the winner.

“That kind of brought tears to my eyes,” recalled Teoh.

The experience ignited her passion for para-sports, which she described as focused on maximising what people have rather than what they lack.

Motivated by this ethos, she started the PlayBuddy programme in 2016 to unlock the potential of children with physical disabilities. It brings together more than 10 children and their families every Saturday to enjoy activities like taekwondo, football and bowling.

Since its inception, more than 50 families have benefitted from the programme, which has grown into a supportive community. “Their entire world may sometimes revolve just around that child, (with parents) taking them to school, … medical appointments, therapy,” said Teoh.

“So when they come together like this, parents talk to other parents who may have gone on a similar journey. … They kind of encourage one another, share stories and don’t feel so alone.”

Similarly, when Ronita Paul, 72, and Geraldine Lee, 66, co-founded Arc Children’s Centre in 2011, they were creating not only a day care centre but a supportive network for children battling cancer and other critical illnesses, along with their families.

“We never saw Arc as just an organisation or charity,” said Lee. “Arc is like a village.”

Before Arc existed, many of these children could only spend long hours in the hospital playroom, said Frances Yeap, a consultant in paediatric haematology and oncology at the Khoo Teck Puat – National University Children’s Medical Institute, National University Hospital.

“Because that was a safe area for them to be playing, where their parents were more reassured that there were no germs … (and) that other children playing around them also had a similar medical problem.”

To date, more than 300 children have walked through Arc’s doors. Beyond day care, Arc hosts camps and events like a year-end talent competition for children to showcase the skills they have honed at the centre.

“Arc is really like a sanctuary for these children to have some sort of normalcy in life,” Yeap added.

CNA,A 5-year-old moves in with new foster parents. This is what happens in the first month,"*Name has been changed.

SINGAPORE: With a clatter and a thud, five-year-old *Isaac plopped down at his new foster parents’ doorstep and started strapping on an elbow pad.

“I want to go rollerblading!” he announced.

His enthusiasm left Natalie Ong, 34, and Matthew Chia, 37, both charmed and confounded. Having braced themselves for tears or shyness, the couple knelt to help him into his well-worn gear instead, surrounded by bags of clothes and toys.



Moments later, he yanked it all off. “No, I’ll go cycling!” he declared, clambering onto his bicycle.

As he darted towards the lift, his foster parents quickly brought his bags inside their house and grabbed a water bottle on the way out. Ong and Chia exchanged amused glances — the home tour would have to wait.

It was not quite the start the couple had expected, but as Isaac’s chatter filled the air, they felt the first stirrings of something unmistakeable: a sense of family.

Speaking to CNA Insider a month later, the couple said they felt inspired by their affection for children to get into fostering.

Ong, a special needs teacher, has enjoyed working with children and also has “a soft spot for those in need”. She had the idea of fostering after coming across news stories on it.

Under Singapore’s foster care system, children are temporarily placed in foster families when their birth parents cannot provide a safe home environment owing to abuse, neglect or abandonment.

Fostering provides these children with a secure family environment, with the aim of returning them to their birth families eventually, once the latter are assessed as safe to resume care for them.

Foster care applicants undergo suitability assessments, which include interview sessions, home visits, medical screening and reference checks. After approval, foster parents need to attend foundational and intermediate training courses to equip themselves with skills for supporting their foster child.

As to Ong and Chia’s approach to fostering? That would be to take things one step at a time.

“There’s a first for everything, so we didn’t know what to expect,” said Chia, who is a civil servant. “For the first night together, we’ve heard stories of kids who can’t sleep or (who) start crying and vomiting.”

To their relief, Isaac not only showed up cheerfully at their door, but also slept through the first night.

Even when he met their extended family that same evening, he took to them immediately. “They were shocked at how sociable he was,” said Ong. “He just spoke to them like he’d known them for a long time.”

Chia thought it was “probably one of the best-case scenarios”, in which the foster child “adjusts very quickly”, though he said their training classes had helped them to prepare mentally for a spectrum of possible reactions from the child.

One of the couple’s priorities was building rapport with Isaac, which they did through the power of play.

“One thing we definitely did was to bring him to do things he enjoys,” said Ong, describing him as a boy “who needs his outdoor time”.

Since he moved in, the couple have been more physically active. Their activities as a foster family involve plenty of rollerblading or cycling in the evenings and weekend outings to parks and attractions.

And with all the energy he expends, he continues to sleep well at night. “He eats well, … he plays well,” said Ong. “I think it was all about establishing routines.”

But the first week was a period of adaptation, for example, to Isaac’s extroversion. His chatty, curious nature initially drained Ong’s social battery until she had “no energy to talk to anybody”.

“(Now) I prepare my brain (for) when he’s … home (after school),” she quipped. “I need to be prepared to talk until bedtime.”

For Chia, maintaining a more regular schedule has been the biggest adjustment. The couple used to sleep late, but now they go to bed by 10pm to get Isaac into the routine. They also take regular meals as a family.

Any attempt at enforcing naptime on non-school days has gone out the window, however, as Isaac “can last the whole day”. Instead, he gets to play or read in his room — “quiet time” — which gives the couple some respite.

This also helps his attentional focus as “he’s easily distracted”, said Ong, who joked that she “never realised how much (she) treasured peace and quiet” until she met Isaac.

With such an outgoing and exuberant young charge, the couple were also mindful of the need to establish some boundaries. “Timers really help,” said Chia. “He knows that when it’s time to go, it’s time to go.”

Although Isaac may “try to be cheeky” and talk his way out of things at times, the couple said adopting a firmer tone has worked well in getting him to cooperate when needed.

“I tell him there’s a time to play and … to joke and to feel what you feel,” said Ong. “But there’s also a time (when) we need to listen, … shower or sleep. And we explain why we do these things.”

Foster parents are not allowed to use physical punishment as a form of discipline. They are taught to use positive parenting strategies instead, such as setting boundaries, rewarding good behaviour, withdrawing privileges and providing explanations for natural and logical consequences.

So when Isaac acts out in weekend classes in church, he will lose some of his outdoor activity privileges for the day. This usually results in tears, but the couple will hug him and explain the consequences of disruptive behaviour.

“Five minutes later, he’s back to normal,” said Chia.

Before bedtime, the couple also make a point of discussing what has happened in the day with Isaac, while providing reassurance.

“(We tell him): ‘Today, Isaac didn’t do this, but Auntie and Uncle forgive you. It’s okay, and Auntie and Uncle still love you,’” Ong shared. “He understands it, and he automatically apologises.”

While Isaac’s first week with his new foster family went largely without a hitch, there were some teething issues.

At times he asked them if he could call his former foster family, who had cared for him for a year. “He misses his ‘jie jie’ (older sister) the most,” said Ong, referring to Isaac’s former foster family’s daughter.

His caseworker advised the couple, however, to keep their distance from his former foster family for now, to aid his transition to his new home. “If he calls (them),” Ong also wondered, “how long (will) he … keep calling them?”

Should Isaac have asked to contact them again, an alternative would have been to get him to draw a card that could be passed to them. But after the first week, he did not make any further requests, she said.

“Now he calls them the ‘old mummy and old daddy with jie jie,’” said Ong, adding that he also came to call his former foster household his “old home”.

Ong and Chia, meanwhile, have been arranging playdates for him with their niece and nephew, hoping to give him somewhat of the companionship he had with his former foster sister.

While the couple describe him as a jovial and confident child, they have seen brief but telling indicators of how he has been coping with the transition.

Ong recounted how, in the first week, Isaac was “laughing hysterically in the shower” once, and she stepped in to remind him that there was a time for everything, including when to laugh.

Without missing a beat, he replied: “There’s a time to feel sad too.”

Ong affirmed him immediately and said that such feelings were perfectly normal. “(I’ve) just been reminding him that … he can let us know when he feels these things also,” she said.

At another time, in the middle of the night, he quietly tapped Ong to awake her and ask if she could hold his hand and stay at his bedside until he fell asleep again.

“He (also) randomly told me: ‘Before I slept at night, my old mummy told me, ‘I love you,’” continued Ong, who now repeats those words to him every night.

“This boy needs security, needs someone to love him. … I hope to hear a bit more about his emotions (over time) — how he feels on a deeper level.”

For now, Ong and Chia are focused on giving Isaac a stable, nurturing environment and have found satisfaction in encouraging his growth and confidence in various activities.

Besides getting better at rollerblading, which has impressed the couple, Isaac’s academic development has also delighted them.

When he first moved in, he could only recognise individual alphabet letters, while his peers could read, write and spell simple words.

After a week with Ong, however, he began to match words to phonetic sounds. He is also learning to tell the time.

Seeing his “joy in learning” has been the most rewarding part of her fostering journey so far, especially since he has just a year to go before he transitions to primary school.

“(It’s about) knowing that his future will be a bit easier with each step as we go along,” said the educator, “that he’ll be readier for Primary 1, and his self-esteem won’t be so affected.”

For Chia, his most rewarding moments include hearing Isaac give thanks “for Uncle and Auntie” in their family prayers before bedtime, such as for feeding him and taking him out to have fun.

“(I’m glad) we’re able to make some difference in his life or at least help him to feel (more) secure and loved,” said Chia.

While there are plans for Isaac to be reunited with his birth family, this depends on when they can adequately address child safety concerns and related risks to allow for safe reunification.

Currently, his biological family has weekly access sessions with him, which will increase in duration and frequency as they work towards full reunification. Ong and Chia have committed themselves to supporting this transition, though they feel some concern.

“We’re always (taking) him out to play,” Ong cited as an example of how his foster care experiences would shape his expectations for his birth family and daily routine.

“All of us are showing him so much love, blessing him with so much. … (How will all this) affect his ability to cope when he returns (to his birth family)?”

Isaac’s birth family is working with community partners, like their family service centre social worker, to improve the quality of their interaction with their child. For instance, they are working at limiting his screen time when he is with them.

When he does eventually leave his foster family, Ong will miss his presence and “funny antics” most of all. But the couple are prepared to avoid contact with him to aid his return to his birth family.

“We don’t want to … make him constantly think about the past,” said Ong. “It’s good for him to just be happy with his (birth) family also.”

In the meantime, the couple are intent on enjoying their time with Isaac, however much of it they have left.

“I can see why he’s placed here — not just for his benefit but for ours as well,” said Chia. “We’re learning to care, learning to love, just as much as he’s receiving care and receiving love.”",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/cna-insider/new-foster-parents-child-moving-in-first-month-family-4967616,2025-05-19T12:55:40Z

CNA,"How Shopee is winning over shoppers with content, AI and speed","Browsing for home goods or fashion online? It’s no longer just about convenience – today’s shoppers want speed, relevance and a seamless experience.

They’re after tailored recommendations, engaging content and the assurance to make confident decisions – all backed by fast delivery, good value and a wide product range. With platforms like Shopee enabling streamlined, tech-powered experiences, forward-looking brands are turning discovery into conversion.

By blending content strategies, artificial intelligence (AI)-powered journeys and efficient fulfilment, Shopee is helping sellers connect more meaningfully with customers and scale faster. These themes took centre stage at the Shopee Brands Summit 2025, where more than 300 brand leaders gathered to explore what’s next for e-commerce.

SEE IT, WANT IT: BUILDING CONNECTION THROUGH VISUAL CONTENT

In online shopping, visuals often speak louder than words. Meltwater’s Global Digital Report 2024 found that 80 per cent of shoppers prefer interactive imagery, video and live selling formats over text-heavy listings.

This shift is transforming e-commerce in Southeast Asia – video-led commerce made up 20 per cent of the region’s total e-commerce gross merchandise value (GMV) in 2024, a significant increase from 2022, according to the e-Conomy SEA 2024 report by Bain & Company, Google and Temasek.

Shopee is riding this wave of video-led commerce, with internal research showing that listings featuring video content can achieve up to double the conversion rates. Shopee Video provides a dedicated space for immersive demonstrations and product storytelling.

While video content can be found across many platforms, a Kantar study reported that Gen Z consumers still prefer to complete their purchases on dedicated e-commerce platforms, valuing the security, ease and reliability they provide.

Tapping into this, YouTube partnered with Shopee to launch the YouTube Shopping Affiliate Program in Singapore. This initiative allows creators to tag Shopee products directly in their videos, Shorts and livestreams – letting viewers discover products on YouTube and transition smoothly to Shopee to complete their purchases.

For sellers, it opens new pathways to reach audiences through trusted voices. For creators, it’s another way to monetise their influence. It’s a win-win that speaks to younger consumers’ appetite for integrated, entertaining shopping experiences.

As video formats evolve, live selling is opening new doors for brands to connect with shoppers and the results are starting to show. In Singapore alone, Shopee Live saw 3.5 times year-on-year GMV growth, fuelled by brands that are using the format to enhance outcomes.

Unilever, for instance, tapped into Shopee’s insights to identify top-performing hosts who could drive conversion more effectively than in-store promoters. At the Shopee Brands Summit 2025, FLY Entertainment CEO Irene Ang highlighted how the right on-screen personality can build authenticity and brand loyalty, turning viewers into long-term customers.

Stryv, meanwhile, capitalised on live features like real-time Q&A and flash deals to build trust and boost engagement.

SMARTER SHOPPING STARTS WITH AI

Shopee uses AI where it matters most – helping shoppers discover what they need faster and enabling sellers to reach the right audience.

“We aim to apply AI thoughtfully across our ecosystem to create more personalised shopping experiences that benefit both consumers and brands,” said Mr Chua Kel Jin, director at Shopee Singapore.

AI is already enhancing key moments in the user journey. Shopee’s Estimated Delivery Time predictions use machine learning to offer clearer timelines based on purchase behaviour, logistics and shipping options. Its Review Summaries, powered by AI, condense thousands of reviews into concise highlights, helping shoppers decide at a glance.

More tools are also on the way. The AI Shopping Assistant curates recommendations based on browsing behaviour, while the upcoming AI Shop Chatbot will help sellers respond faster and streamline service. In a digital landscape where average screen time per page has dropped from 2.5 minutes to just 47 seconds, helping users cut through the noise has never been more critical.

SHOP TODAY, GET IT TOMORROW

A seamless online experience only works when matched with fast, reliable delivery. Since last year, Shopee has seen a 13-fold surge in demand for next-day fulfilment, with 51 per cent of shoppers now expecting to receive their orders within just two days.

Shopee supports sellers in meeting these expectations through Fulfilled by Shopee, a comprehensive logistics solution that handles automated warehousing, inventory, real-time tracking and last-mile delivery. Paired with the Estimated Delivery Time feature, this integrated logistics approach enhances transparency, reduces cart abandonment and encourages repeat purchases, ensuring that engaging content and smart AI recommendations translate into doorstep satisfaction.

POWERING THE FUTURE OF E-COMMERCE, TOGETHER

As content, AI and speed continue to influence the way people shop, brands on Shopee are better placed to adapt, connect and grow. With smarter tools and stronger support, sellers can move faster, serve better and unlock new opportunities in an evolving digital landscape.

“Shopee will keep investing in the right capabilities, from AI to logistics, to help brands scale sustainably,” said Mr Chua.

CNA,Fighting AI with AI in cybersecurity,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionising industries, boosting efficiency and transforming workflows. But as AI becomes more integrated in daily life, it is also creating vulnerabilities, opening the door to increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks.

At global cybersecurity company Palo Alto Networks’ Ignite on Tour Singapore 2025 conference in March, industry leaders gathered to discuss AI’s growing influence on the digital threat landscape. As AI-powered attacks become more advanced, organisations must rethink their security strategies.

In remarks shared during a post-event interview, Mr Steven Scheurmann, regional vice-president of ASEAN at Palo Alto Networks, said that operational complexity, fragmented IT and security functions, and the rapid adoption of AI and automation by threat actors are the key cybersecurity challenges today.

To stay ahead, organisations need a hybrid-by-design approach, where security is built in from the outset alongside AI and cloud infrastructure. One key enabler of this shift is platformisation – the integration of security technologies across the organisation to help break down silos, safeguard AI initiatives and build a coordinated defence posture.

“Embedding security into AI-driven operations from the start helps ensure that organisations can stay ahead of attackers, rather than playing catch-up,” Mr Scheurmann said, referencing findings from Palo Alto Networks’ joint research with IBM.

THE RISE OF AI-ENABLED THREATS

AI has lowered the barrier to entry for cybercriminals, allowing them to automate attacks, craft convincing phishing campaigns and develop advanced malware with unprecedented ease.

In his keynote address, guest of honour Edward Chen, deputy chief executive (National Cyber Resilience) of the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore, cautioned that AI-enabled cyberthreats are accelerating in both scale and sophistication. He cited a December 2024 report by Palo Alto Networks threat intelligence arm, Unit 42, which found that large language models could generate malware variants that evade detection 88 per cent of the time. “Imagine the implications of malware that can bypass traditional security measures nearly nine out of 10 times,” he said.

Beyond known vulnerabilities – such as misconfigurations, unpatched systems and weak credentials – AI has introduced new types of cyberattacks. One example is prompt injection attacks, where adversaries manipulate AI models into exposing sensitive data or executing harmful commands.

Mr Scheurmann also flagged the surge in financially motivated cyberattacks designed to disrupt operations, with ransom demands nearly doubling in the past year. Other rising threats include the misuse of stolen data for blackmail, harassment or sale on dark web marketplaces as well as browser-based attacks, which account for 44 per cent of security incidents, according to the Unit 42 2025 Global Incident Response Report.

These developments add another layer of complexity. Organisations must navigate breach disclosures, data security laws and contractual obligations – all of which can carry significant regulatory and reputational consequences. “Without visibility into how data is accessed and shared – especially with the proliferation of AI tools – businesses can face serious challenges in compliance and the protection of sensitive information,” Mr Scheurmann emphasised.

The growing sophistication of cyberattacks is also driving up costs. Mr Andy Piazza, senior director of threat intelligence at Unit 42, noted that large-scale breaches are inflicting damage in the billions. “Threat actors – and researchers like us – are successfully leveraging AI at different stages of the kill chain,” he said, referring to the various phases of a cyberattack, from reconnaissance to data transfer. With AI accelerating every step, attacks are becoming more frequent, targeted and difficult to stop, he added.

Still, experts agree that AI is not just a weapon for attackers – it is also a powerful asset in defence. “After all, you don’t bring a knife to a gunfight,” said Mr Chen. “If cybercriminals are using AI-driven tactics, we must do the same.”

SMARTER PROTECTION WITH PRISMA ACCESS BROWSER

To stay ahead of AI-powered attacks, organisations should start their defences at one of the most vulnerable points – the browser.

From cloud-based tools to everyday communication platforms, the modern workplace runs largely on web applications. Yet traditional security often fails to protect users at the point of access, leaving browsers exposed to phishing, account takeovers, malware and malicious extensions.

Mr Simon Green, president of Palo Alto Networks Asia Pacific and Japan, shared: “85 per cent of work now takes place on the browser, with 64 per cent of browser traffic encrypted. That creates blind spots. Without the right safeguards in place, the browser becomes a critical vulnerability.”

If sensitive data in third-party applications is accessed via an AI-driven prompt, it can pose a serious security risk. To address this, Palo Alto Networks’ Prisma Access Browser delivers real-time protection directly within the browser. It proactively identifies and blocks risks as users work and collaborate across cloud apps and devices.

“In this era of hybrid work, securing the browser is more critical than ever,” said Mr Scheurmann. “Prisma Access Browser is purpose-built for this, embedding advanced features that give organisations real-time visibility and enforce access controls – no matter the device.”

The browser’s built-in data loss prevention capabilities provide granular control over actions like screen sharing, clipboard use and file transfers – based on factors such as user profile, device security status and usage context. This helps keep sensitive data secure, even in remote or bring-your-own-device environments, where employees use personal devices for work.

Through cloud infrastructure investments in Australia, India, Indonesia, Japan and Singapore, the solution is integrated into existing systems in these key markets, helping organisations strike a balance between security and productivity.

WORKING TOGETHER FOR A SAFER FUTURE

Securing the digital landscape in the age of AI takes more than just advanced technology – it requires collaboration across industries.

As part of its commitment to building a safer digital ecosystem, Palo Alto Networks is working closely with industry, government and academia. Among its initiatives are Cyber Safe Kids and tailored curricula and technical resources for universities in Singapore – aimed at equipping the next generation of cybersecurity professionals with the skills to tackle emerging threats.

Mr Scheurmann noted that cybercriminals often share tools, tactics and intelligence in a highly coordinated manner, which gives them a distinct advantage. In contrast, the cybersecurity industry has traditionally operated in silos, limiting its ability to respond effectively. “The key to combating AI-driven threats is collaboration. Governments, businesses and cybersecurity firms must work together, sharing insights, strategies and technologies to build a unified defence.”

This spirit of collaboration was a recurring theme at Ignite on Tour Singapore 2025. Echoing the call for joint action, Mr Chen stressed the importance of collective responsibility. “No single entity can secure cyberspace alone. But together, we can turn AI into our greatest advantage, not our greatest vulnerability.”

CNA,Pivoting with purpose: How upskilling empowered these career comebacks,"When Mr Lionel Hong Weide found himself struggling to land a job in the tech industry in 2023, it was a sobering moment. Despite years of experience as a project coordinator in digital education and website development, coupled with a solid list of professional achievements, the job hunt was tougher than expected.

Mr Hong’s story isn’t unique. As companies grapple with the impact of the volatile global economy, many workers are beginning to feel the squeeze.

With more workers upskilling and reskilling to build career resilience, NTUC LearningHub – one of Singapore’s largest continuing education and training providers – is supporting this transition with train-and-place courses under the SkillsFuture Career Transition Programme (SCTP). Courses are currently offered in three growth sectors – technology, healthcare and retail.

Mr Hong, along with two mid-career workers, share how the SCTP with NTUC LearningHub has enabled them to pivot and progress in their careers.

EXPANDING SKILL SETS BEYOND TECH FOR MORE OPPORTUNITIES

Keen to broaden his portfolio with capabilities such as building wireframe products and mobile app prototypes, Mr Hong enrolled in NTUC LearningHub’s SCTP Associate UI/UX Designer course. There, he earned the Human Factors International Certified Usability Analyst certification – a valuable credential that strengthened his technical foundation.

As the course progressed, Mr Hong discovered it offered much more than just hard skills. Through team-based activities and real-world scenarios, he developed stronger collaboration and communication abilities, rounding out a holistic skill set that made him a more competitive job candidate.

For example, Mr Hong and his course mates worked through differing perspectives to co-develop solutions that met their shared objectives – a process that sharpened his problem-solving, critical thinking and interpersonal skills.

Armed with both technical and soft skills, Mr Hong now thrives as a technical project manager at an IT services company. He secured the role last year, shortly after completing another course at NTUC LearningHub – Project Management Professional.

“In my current job, I am able to provide insights on how product features can be improved,” he shared. “I’ve contributed ideas on accessibility, including features that better support colour-blind users.”

Mr Hong embraces lifelong learning as a strategy for career growth. After being seconded to a company providing carbon reduction solutions in 2024, he identified an opportunity to grow in the green sector. To build on this, he completed the Certified Sustainability Practitioner programme at NTUC LearningHub. The following year, he earned a Practitioner Certificate in Personal Data Protection, qualifying him to serve as a data protection officer.

“Beyond boosting my employability, being exposed to up-to-date course materials and new networks at NTUC LearningHub gave me fresh insights and reshaped my thinking,” reflected Mr Hong.

STAYING AHEAD OF THE CURVE WITH CERTIFICATIONS

With the IT sector rapidly evolving, Mr Mohammad Redza, in his 40s, started exploring industry-recognised certifications to keep pace with changes in the desktop support domain, where he had built a 15-year career.

“I saw peers around me being laid off,” he added. “That made it even more urgent for me to upskill and get the right qualifications to stay relevant in the ever-changing IT landscape. These certifications could also help me progress towards becoming a team lead.”

He enrolled in the SCTP Desktop Support Engineer programme at NTUC LearningHub, seeing the certifications offered as a way to strengthen his resume and skill sets.

Although he had prior IT experience, certain modules – such as the Network+ (Plus) Certification – were challenging. But by seeking guidance from trainers and peers throughout his course, Mr Redza successfully completed his certifications and capstone projects. Along the way, he also built industry connections, which he believes will be useful in the future.

“I would say to others, there is always support available – you just need to ask,” he said. “It’s encouraging that NTUC LearningHub provides a platform where we can upskill, network and earn relevant certifications.”

Today, Mr Redza is an IT support specialist at a company involved in marine telecommunications. He plans to continue upskilling himself to earn industry-relevant certifications, believing that staying up to date with evolving technologies is key to career resilience.

“The SCTP helped me take the first step towards career growth – but I’m not stopping here. I want to be the one shaping my own path,” he said.

FINDING CAREER INSPIRATION FROM CAREGIVING

After Mdm Lim Hui Ling’s husband suffered a stroke in 2023, she devoted herself fully to supporting his recovery. The experience was both a challenge and a source of inspiration for her, she recalled.

“Seeing the dedication of the physiotherapists who helped my husband on his mobility recovery journey made me want to give back to the community, too,” explained the 52-year-old. With her children grown and 20 years spent as a full-time homemaker after leaving her role as an early childhood educator, she felt it was time to rejoin the workforce.

While the idea of returning to work after a long break was daunting, the SCTP Certificate in Therapy Support (Healthcare) at NTUC LearningHub helped ease the transition. The programme boosted her confidence and equipped her with the necessary skills that ultimately led to a role in the healthcare sector.

Today, Mdm Lim is a therapy aide at a rehabilitation centre, where she guides patients through tailored exercises and circuit routines, and documents their daily progress.

“The SCTP’s hands-on training and role-playing activities taught me vital skills – from patient mobility support and safety protocols to therapy techniques,” she shared. “The course also helped me become a more confident communicator with patients.”

Mdm Lim acknowledged that upskilling takes dedication but said that each milestone is worth celebrating. “Be patient with yourself. Don’t be afraid to ask for help from mentors and colleagues,” she shared. “Lifelong learning is worthwhile because it empowers you to grow, adapt and make a difference in people’s lives.”

CNA,"Chart your own path towards career growth, with SMU Academy’s Industry Practice Master of Digital Economy","As rapid technological advancements continue to transform workplaces, mid-career professionals in Singapore face growing pressure to adapt swiftly.

In response, more professionals are turning to lifelong learning. The recently revamped Industry Practice Master of Digital Economy (IPMDE) is a flexible, stackable postgraduate degree programme designed to help professionals gain industry-relevant skills to support their career growth.

The programme is offered by the professional training arm of Singapore Management University (SMU), SMU Academy, which provides over 1,500 approved courses and upskills more than 20,000 learners annually. According to Professor Gary Pan, academic director of lifelong learning at SMU, the IPMDE aims to close knowledge gaps for mid-career professionals in high-demand areas such as digital economy and innovation, data governance and compliance, supply chain and operations, leadership and management, and customer experience.

“By acquiring expertise in these domains, professionals can deepen their expertise, enhance career prospects or transition into new roles in the digital economy,” he said.

AFFORDABLE ACCESS TO SKILLS UPGRADING

The IPMDE is currently the only postgraduate master’s programme where skills-based modules are subsidised up to 90 per cent by SkillsFuture Singapore. Eligible candidates can also utilise their S$4,000 SkillsFuture Credit (Mid-Career) for skills-based modules.

“This makes the IPMDE one of the most affordable options for mid-career individuals seeking to upskill through a postgraduate qualification,” noted Prof Pan. He added that SMU’s strong industry network and resources further enrich the learning experience.

“Beyond financial assistance such as SkillsFuture funding and credits, IPMDE learners benefit from career development support, including coaching and networking opportunities. These resources will aid them in career planning and progression,” he shared.

A FLEXIBLE APPROACH ALIGNED WITH YOUR NEEDS

Launched in 2023, the IMPDE programme was recently revamped to improve accessibility and flexibility. For example, it will now recognise selected diplomas and continuing education and training (CET) certificates from local polytechnics and autonomous universities, as well as prior learning from CET courses completed at SMU Academy.

The revamp also introduces industry graduate diplomas (IGDs), which offer a more modular, flexible and industry-aligned learning experience. Learners can choose to enrol directly in the IPMDE or begin with an IGD and decide later whether to continue or customise their learning path. They may also pursue targeted, industry-recognised credentials that suit their career goals.

This stackable structure is especially beneficial for mid-career professionals seeking flexibility and career advancement. It provides a lower barrier to entry for those who may not initially meet traditional admissions criteria or prefer not to commit to a full master’s programme upfront, while allowing for a seamless progression from an IGD to a full postgraduate qualification.

“The IPMDE’s modular design enables learners to select courses that align with their career goals and schedules, allowing for a balance between educational and professional responsibilities,” said Prof Pan.

REAL-WORLD LEARNING THAT BUILDS SKILLS AND CONNECTIONS

To ensure that course content remains aligned with current market needs, the IPMDE curriculum is co-developed with SMU Academy’s industry partners. Learners also have the opportunity to engage in work-based learning through the 13-week SMU-X Lifelong Learning (SMU-XL), an extension of SMU’s Industry Project-Based Experiential Learning programme.

As part of SMU-XL, SMU Academy connects learners with industry partners to gain hands-on experience in solving real business challenges. “By engaging in projects that allow them to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios, learners enhance their practical skills and job readiness,” explained Prof Pan.

He encourages mid-career professionals to take full advantage of the work-based learning opportunities offered by the IPMDE, as they provide valuable experience and a chance to build meaningful connections with peers, mentors and industry partners.

Above all, a willingness to embrace lifelong learning is key to succeeding in the IPMDE programme and strengthening one’s employability and career advancement, he noted. “It’s important to stay updated with emerging digital trends and continuously seek to apply new knowledge in your professional settings.”
